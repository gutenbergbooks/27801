<h1><small>CHILDREN OF BORNEO</small></h1>



<h2>CHAPTER I<br /><br />
<small>THE ISLAND OF BORNEO&mdash;JUNGLES&mdash;THE DYAKS&mdash;DYAK
LIFE IN THE OLD DAYS</small></h2>


<p>Away down in the Indian Ocean there is a long chain
of islands that stretches from Burmah to Australia.
One of these is New Guinea which is the largest
island in the world (leaving out Australia), and Borneo
comes next in size. It is nearly four times as large as
England. One quarter of it&mdash;the States of Sarawak
and British North Borneo&mdash;is under British influence.
The rest is all claimed by the Dutch, excepting one
small State, Brunei, between North Borneo and
Sarawak, which is governed by a Malay Sultan, who is
a Mahommedan. Sarawak is governed by an English
Rajah, or King, Sir Charles Brooke, who succeeded his
uncle, Sir James Brooke, in 1868;&mdash;British North
Borneo is owned by an English Trading Company,
called the North Borneo Company, who appoint an
Englishman as Governor to rule it for them.</p>

<p>If you look at a map of Borneo you will see that the
Equator divides the island into two parts, so that
Borneo is right in the middle of the Torrid Zone. The
climate is therefore tropical, that is to say there is no
spring, autumn or winter, but only summer, and it is
always much hotter in Borneo than it is in the hottest
summer in England. So, if an English boy went to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>live in Borneo, he would find his English clothes too
thick and warm for him to wear there, and he would
have to have thin cotton garments.</p>

<p>Most of the country of Borneo is covered with thick
jungle, where large forest trees grow close to each other,
many of them with trunks over six feet in diameter.
These trees are often loaded with creepers and ferns,
and from the branches, high up overhead, beautiful
orchids hang.</p>

<p>The natives of Borneo are called Dyaks, and these
tropical jungles are their home. Let me try and
describe to you what these people are like. They are
not black like negroes, but have a brown skin. They
are not as tall as Englishmen, but are slightly bigger
than the Malays. The Dyak men and women wear very
little clothing because of the great heat. The Dyak
men wear a waistcloth which is made either of the soft
inner bark of a tree, or else of cotton cloth. It is about
one yard wide, and from eight to eighteen feet in
length, and is twisted round and round their waists
and pulled up tight between the thighs, one end
hanging down in front and the other behind. Dyak
women wear a short petticoat which is drawn tightly
round the waist and reaches down to the knees. Round
their bodies the women wear hoops of rattan, a kind
of cane, and these are threaded through small brass
rings placed so close together as to hide the rattan.
Both men and women wear necklaces, bracelets, and
ear-rings. The men wear their hair long, and they
blacken their teeth and often file them to a point, or
bore holes in them and insert brass studs into them.</p>

<p>Let me tell you something of the kind of life
the Dyaks used to live in the old days. You have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
heard of the head-hunters of Borneo. Seventy years
ago the Dyaks were one of the most savage and cruel
people in the world. In those days there was constant
warfare between the different tribes. The Dyaks
therefore lived together in large numbers in long
village houses, and round these houses they built
strong stockades, as a defence against any sudden
attack.</p>

<p>In those old days a party of Dyaks would often
attack some neighbouring house. Such of the men
as were at home would repel the attack as best they
could, for defeat meant certain death. The women
and children would be crowded together in the
verandah of the Dyak house, and the men, armed with
swords, spears and shields, would form a circle round
them. Large brass gongs would be struck in a
peculiar manner, to let the neighbours know of the
attack, and to implore their help. The fight would
continue till one party was defeated. If any came to
the rescue, the attacking party would retreat, pursued
by such of the inmates of the house as dared to follow
them; but if no help came, the house would be rushed,
the men and women cut down, and the children killed
or taken captive. The heads of the dead would be cut
off amid wild whoops of joy, and carried off in triumph.</p>

<p>The Dyaks thought it a grand thing to be able to
bring home a human head to hang up as an ornament
in their house. The man who succeeded in securing
a human head was looked upon as a great warrior,
and so very often the young braves would make an
expedition against some tribe simply because they
wanted to bring home the ghastly trophy of a human
head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>Not only were the Dyaks head-hunters in those
days, but many of them were pirates. There was a
great deal of piracy, and it was secretly encouraged
by the native rulers, who obtained a share of the spoil,
and also by the Malays who knew well how to handle
a boat. The Malay fleet consisted of a large number
of long war-boats or <i>prahus</i>, each about ninety feet
long or more, and carrying a brass gun in the bows,
the pirates being armed with swords, spears and
muskets. Each boat was paddled by from sixty to
eighty men. These terrible craft skulked about in the
sheltered coves waiting for their prey, and attacked
merchant vessels making the passage between China
and Singapore. The Malay pirates and their Dyak
allies would wreck and destroy every trading vessel
they came across, murder most of the crew who
offered any resistance, and make slaves of the rest.
The Dyaks would cut off the heads of those who were
slain, smoke them over the fire to dry them, and then
take them home to treasure as valued possessions.
If you visit some of the Dyak houses to-day, you will
see some of these human heads, taken in piratical
raids in old days, hanging in bunches over the fireplaces.</p>

<p>The whole country in those old days was in a great
state of disorder. The Dyaks were constantly at war,
tribe against tribe, and no Dyak village was safe from
sudden attack. Many human lives were sacrificed
because the Dyaks wished, not only to obtain booty,
but to satisfy their lust for blood, and indulge in their
favourite pursuit of head-hunting, and gain glory for
themselves by bringing home human heads to decorate
their houses with.</p>

<small>THE COMING OF THE WHITE RAJAH&mdash;THE MISSIONARIES</small></h2>


<p>I have told you, in the last chapter, what kind of
people the Dyaks were, and how in the old days a great
deal of their time was spent in piracy and in warfare
against neighbouring tribes. Now I want to tell you
of the coming of the White Rajah&mdash;James Brooke&mdash;to
Borneo, and what he did there. I think every
English boy and girl should know the remarkable
and romantic story of how an Englishman came to be
a King in Borneo, and to rule over the part of it called
Sarawak.</p>

<p>James Brooke was born on April 29, 1803. His
father was a member of the Civil Service of the East
India Company, and spent a great many years in
India. He followed his father's example, and entered
the Company's service, and was sent out to India in
1825. Not long after his arrival, he was put in command
of a regiment of soldiers, and ordered to Burmah,
where he took part in the Burmese war. He was
badly wounded, and had to return to England on
leave. For over four years his health prevented him
from rejoining his regiment, and when at last he
started, the voyage took such a long time, owing to a
shipwreck and other misfortunes, that he found on his
arrival that his furlough had expired, and that his
post had been given to someone else. He quitted the
service in 1830.</p>

<p>In that same year he made a voyage to China and
was struck by the natural beauty and fertility of the
islands of the Indian Archipelago, and he felt sad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
when he thought of the tribes who inhabited these
beautiful islands. They were continually at war
with one another, and many of them were pirates.
James Brooke conceived the grand idea of rescuing
these races from barbarism, and of putting down
piracy in the Eastern Archipelago.</p>

<p>On the death of his father he inherited a large sum
of money, and found himself in a position to carry
out his schemes. He bought and equipped a yacht,
the <i>Royalist</i>, and for three years he cruised about,
chiefly in the Mediterranean, training his crew of twenty
men for the hard work that lay before them.</p>

<p>On October 27, 1838 he sailed from the Thames on
his great adventure, travelled slowly on the long
journey round the Cape of Good Hope, and reached
Singapore in 1839. It took the <i>Royalist</i> five months
to reach Singapore, but that was in the days before the
Suez Canal was made. The journey from England to
Singapore can be made in a steam-ship at the present
time in less than a month.</p>

<p>On arriving at Singapore, James Brooke met a shipwrecked
crew who had lately come from Borneo.
They said that they had been kindly treated by Muda
Hassim&mdash;a native Rajah in Borneo&mdash;and they asked
Mr James Brooke to take presents and letters of thanks
to him, if he should be going thither in his yacht. Mr
Brooke had not decided which of the many islands of
the Eastern Archipelago he would visit, and he was as
ready to go to Borneo as to any other; so, setting sail,
he made his way up the Sarawak river, and anchored
off Kuching, the capital, on August 15, 1839. The
country was nominally under the rule of the Sultan of
Brunei, but his uncle, Rajah Muda Hassim, was then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the greatest power in the island. As he was favourable
to English strangers, Mr Brooke paid him a visit
and was most kindly received. The Rajah was at this
time engaged in war with several fierce Dyak tribes
who had revolted against the Sultan, but his efforts
to subdue them were vain. He told Mr James Brooke
his troubles, and begged him to help him to put down
the insurgents, and implored him not to leave him a
prey to his enemies. James Brooke consented to
help him, and began the difficult task of restoring peace
in the country. With his help the rebellion, which the
Malay forces were too feeble to subdue, was brought
to an end. Brooke led the crew of his yacht, and some
Malay followers against the insurgents, and defeated
them. Muda Hassim was very pleased to see that
order was restored in the country, and he conferred on
James Brooke the title of Rajah of Sarawak. It was
some little time before the Sultan of Brunei would
consent to confirm the title, but in 1841 the Government
of Sarawak and its dependencies was formally
made over to James Brooke, and he became the first
English Rajah of Sarawak. He ruled till 1868, when
he died and was succeeded by his nephew, Charles
Johnson Brooke, who is ruling Sarawak to-day.</p>

<p>When James Brooke became king, he set to work
to improve the condition of his subjects. He saw
clearly that the development of commerce was the
best means of civilizing the natives, and, in order to do
this, it was necessary to put down piracy, which not
only appealed to the worst instincts of the Dyaks, but
was a standing danger to European and native traders
in those seas. In the suppression of piracy he found
a vigorous ally in Captain (afterwards Admiral) Keppel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
who, in command of H.M.S. <i>Dido</i>, was summoned from
the China Station in 1843 for this purpose. The pirates
were attacked in their strongholds by Captain Keppel.
They fought desperately, but could not withstand the
superior forces of their enemies. Many of them were
killed, and many escaped and fled into the jungle. In
this way James Brooke put an end to Dyak piracy.</p>

<p>The practice of head-hunting was also dealt with by
James Brooke. He declared it to be a crime. As
soon as he heard that a party had gone on the war-path,
a force was immediately despatched by Government
to endeavour to cut them off and to fine them
heavily. In the event of their having secured human
heads, these had to be given up, and the Dyaks were
asked to pay a large fine. Some refused to follow the
directions of the Government. These were declared
enemies, and were attacked and had their houses burnt
down. This course he steadily pursued for years,
and by his rigorous treatment of head-hunting parties,
James Brooke dealt the death-blow to this horrible
national custom.</p>

<p>After his strenuous life in Sarawak, James Brooke
paid a visit to England in 1847, when many honours
were showered on him. He was graciously received
at Windsor by Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort.
The British Government recognizing the work he had
done, appointed him Governor of Labuan, and made
him a K.C.B.</p>

<p>The putting down of piracy, and the suppressing of
the terrible custom of head-hunting among the Dyaks,
were the first steps that Sir James Brooke took in
civilizing his subjects. But he knew that as long as
the Dyaks held to their old superstitious beliefs in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
evil spirits, there would always be a danger of their
returning to their evil ways. So he began to think
of establishing a Christian Mission in Sarawak. He
knew that it was not enough to put down evil customs:
if the Dyaks were to improve, they must have the true
Faith planted in their hearts.</p>

<p>When Sir James Brooke was in England in 1847, he
appealed to the two Universities of Oxford and Cambridge
and also to the two great Missionary Societies&mdash;the
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
Foreign Parts, and the Church Missionary Society&mdash;to
help him, but none of them were able to do so as
they had not the funds. So a new Association, chiefly
supported by his friends, was started, called the
"Borneo Church Mission." This Association sent out
a few missionaries, the first of whom was the Rev.
F. T. McDougall, who was consecrated the first Bishop
of Labuan and Sarawak in 1855.</p>

<p>After a few years the Borneo Church Mission flagged
for lack of support, and in 1854 the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts came to the
rescue, and took up the work, and has ever since been
responsible for the Mission Work in Borneo. My
father, the Rev. W. H. Gomes, B.D., worked under
Bishop McDougall as a missionary among the Dyaks
of Lundu from 1852 to 1867, and I myself have
worked, under Bishop Hose, as a missionary in Sarawak
for seventeen years.</p>

<p>When McDougall arrived at Kuching, the capital of
Sarawak, in 1848, the Rajah welcomed him kindly,
and gave him a large piece of ground. On this site
were built a church, a school house, and a house for
the Bishop to live in.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Rajah Brooke was anxious that the Dyaks, who
lived far from the town and had their home in the
jungles, should also be taught. Both he and Bishop
McDougall were sorry to think of their heathen state,
and they wanted to save them from becoming converts
to Mohammedanism. So they sent for more helpers
from England, and these missionaries went and lived
among the Dyaks in the jungles. They built their
houses, churches and schools at distant up-country
stations, and they won the love and esteem of the
Dyaks, who came to them, not only to learn to read
and write, but to listen to the wonderful "Old, Old
Story" the missionaries had to tell of a God, Who
loved them, and came to earth and died for them, and
rose from the dead, and ascended up to Heaven, and
Who wanted the whole world to learn of His love and
become His faithful followers.</p>

<br />
<small>A DYAK VILLAGE HOUSE</small></h2>


<p>Among the Dyaks a large number of families live
together under one roof. A small village would consist
probably of one long house, in which twenty or thirty
or more families live. This village house is built on
posts of hard wood, which raise the floor from six to
twelve feet above the ground. It is wise of them to
build their houses in this way, because the ground,
even on the hills, is very damp in the rainy season,
and, besides this, there are snakes and scorpions and
centipedes crawling about, which would trouble the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Dyaks if their houses were built on the ground.
Another reason for building their houses in this way
is that if they live together in large numbers, high
above the ground, it is not easy for their enemies to
attack and overcome them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="house" id="house"></a>
<img  src="images/house.jpg" width="600" height="377" alt="Dyak longhouse" />
<div class="cap">
<p class="caption">A DYAK VILLAGE HOUSE</p>
</div></div>

<p>The entrance to this house is made by a notched
trunk or log, which serves as a ladder; one is fixed
at each end of the house. The length of the building
varies according to the number of families inhabiting
it, but as the rooms occupied by the different families
are built on the same plan, the whole presents a uniform
and regular appearance.</p>

<p>The long Dyak house is built in a straight line, and
the walls and roof are thatched with dried palm leaves.
There is a long uncovered verandah where the paddy<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
is put out to be dried by the sun; afterwards it is
pounded to get rid of its husk, and so converted
into rice. Here, also, the clothes and a variety of
other things are hung out to dry. The flooring of this
part of the house is generally made of laths of hard
wood, so as to stand exposure to the weather. The
flooring of the rest of the house is made of split palm
or bamboo tied down with rattan or cane.</p>

<p>Next to the long uncovered verandah comes the
long open hall, or covered verandah, which stretches
without any partition along the whole length of the
house. It is a cool and pleasant place, and is much
frequented by men and women for conversation and
indoor pursuits. Here the women do their work&mdash;the
weaving of cloth, or the plaiting of mats. Here,
too, the men chop up the firewood used for cooking
their food, and even make boats, if not of too great a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>size. This long hall is a public place open to all comers,
and used as a road by travellers, who climb up the
ladder at one end, walk through the whole length of
the house, and go down the ladder at the other end.
The floor is carpeted with thick and heavy mats made
of cane, interlaced with narrow strips of beaten bark.
Over these are spread other mats of finer texture,
when necessary, for visitors to sit upon, for you must
understand the Dyaks do not use chairs or forms, but
always sit on the floor.</p>

<p>On one side of this long public hall is a row of doors.
Each of these leads into a separate room, which is
occupied by a family. This room serves several
purposes. It serves as a kitchen, because in one
corner there is a fireplace where the food is cooked.
It also serves as a dining-room, because when the meal
is ready, mats are spread here, and the inmates squat
on the floor to eat their meal. It also serves as a bedroom,
and at night the mats for sleeping are spread
out, and here the inmates sleep.</p>

<p>Round three sides of the room&mdash;the fourth side
being occupied by the fireplace&mdash;are ranged the treasured
valuables of the Dyaks&mdash;old earthen jars, some
of which are of great value, and brass gongs and guns.
Their cups and plates are hung up in rows flat against
the wall. The flooring of this room is the same as
that of the public hall outside, and made of split
palm or bamboo tied down with cane. The floor is
swept after a fashion, the refuse falling through the
flooring to the ground underneath. The room is stuffy
and not such a pleasant place as the open hall outside.
The pigs and poultry occupy the waste space under
the house.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>Each family has its own portion of the long public
hall outside, and the length of this corresponds to the
breadth of the room occupied by the family, and in
each of these portions there is a small fireplace which
consists of a slab of stone, at which the men warm
themselves when they get up, as they usually do, in
the chill of the early morning before the sun has risen.</p>

<p>Over this fireplace in the open hall hangs the most
valuable ornament in the eyes of the Dyak, the bunch
of human heads. These are the heads obtained when
on the war-path by various members of the family&mdash;dead
and living&mdash;and handed down from father to son
as the most precious heirlooms&mdash;more precious, indeed,
than the ancient jars which the Dyaks prize so highly.</p>

<p>The posts in this public part of the Dyak village
house are often adorned with the horns of deer and
the tusks of wild boar. The empty sheaths of swords
are hung from these horns or from wooden hooks, while
the naked blades are placed in racks overhead.</p>

<p>If you can imagine a long house built several feet
above the ground on posts, with walls and roof of palm
leaf thatch, and this house divided into two parts,
one a large public hall common to all the inmates, and
the other divided into separate rooms each occupied
by a different family, then you have some idea of the
kind of house in which the Dyaks live.</p>

<p>The women are earlier risers than the men, and
retire to bed earlier. They generally go to the river
as soon as they wake, carrying their water-gourds
with them. They have a bath, fill their gourds with
water, and return to the house to cook the morning
meal.</p>

<p>The principal article of food is rice, which is cooked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in brass or iron pots. With their rice they eat either
vegetables or fish. Sometimes they have the flesh
of wild pig or deer, but that is not usual. Nearly
every animal is eaten by the Dyaks; fish, venison and
pork are eaten by all, and many tribes eat monkeys,
snakes and even crocodiles. A favourite method of
cooking is to put the proper quantity of fish or vegetables
or meat, with sufficient water and a little salt,
into a newly-cut bamboo. The mouth is then stopped
up with leaves, and the bamboo is placed over the fire,
resting on a stone at an angle of forty-five degrees or
more. By the time the bamboo is thoroughly charred,
the contents are sufficiently cooked, and it is taken
from the fire and emptied out into a plate. Sometimes
rice is cooked in bamboos, and when it is ready
to be eaten, the bamboo is split and torn off in strips,
and the rice is found well cooked inside&mdash;a stiff mass
moulded in the form of the bamboo.</p>

<p>When the food is ready and put out in plates, the
men are asked to come into the room and eat. Sometimes
the women eat with the men; but if there are
too many to eat comfortably at one sitting, the men
have their meal first, and the women eat with the
children after the men have done.</p>

<p>The Dyaks all sit on the floor, which also serves as
their table. They have their rice on plates, or sometimes
upon clean leaves. They eat with their
fingers, dipping the hand when necessary into the
common stock of salt or common dish of meat or
vegetables. They eat with the right hand, compressing
the rice into portions of convenient size.</p>

<p>When the meal is over, they wash the crockery and
put it away. The mats are swept and taken up, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
refuse thrown through the open floor for the pigs
and poultry under the house to eat.</p>

<p>The floor of the Dyak house is clean enough because
all the dirt falls through on to the ground underneath;
consequently this is covered with rubbish, and perpetually
wet from the water thrown down from the
floor above, and, being the favourite resort of the pigs
and fowls of the long Dyak house, often smells horribly.</p>

<h2><a name="Chap_IV" id="Chap_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
<small>DYAK BABIES AND CHILDREN</small></h2>

<p>A Dyak baby is much like any other baby in being
a little helpless human thing that spends most of his
time in sleeping and feeding, worrying its mother
with its constant wants, but yet loved greatly by her,
and as it grows up, making its parents proud of it,
and amusing them by its cunning little ways. Its
colour varies from a light brown with a tinge of yellow
to a dark chocolate, and it wears no clothing at all
until it is five or six years old.</p>

<p>Until a civilised government interfered to prevent
such cruel murders, there used to be a custom among
the Dyaks that if the mother died when her child
was born, the poor babe should pay the penalty and
be buried with the mother. The reasons given for
this cruel act was that the child was the cause of the
mother's death, and that there was no one to nurse
and care for it. No woman would dare to nurse such
an orphan, lest it should bring misfortune upon her
own children. Therefore the poor child was often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
placed alive in the coffin with the dead mother, and
both were buried together. That was the old cruel
Dyak custom, but I am glad to say it is a long time
since it has been carried out. I have myself known
many cases among the Dyaks where the mother has
died, and the orphan has been adopted and brought
up by some friend or relative.</p>

<p>When a child is born a fowl is waved over it as a
kind of offering to the gods and spirits. This fowl is
then killed, cooked, and eaten by the parents, and any
friends that may be present.</p>

<p>During the first three days the child receives its
bath in a wooden vessel in the house, but on the
fourth day it is taken to the river. Some curious
ceremonies attend its first bath in the river. An old
man of some standing, who has been successful in his
undertakings, is asked to bathe the child. He wades
into the river holding the child in his arms. A fowl
is killed on the bank, a wing is cut off, and if the child
be a boy this wing is stuck upon a spear, and if a girl
it is fixed to the slip of wood used to pass between the
threads in weaving, and this is fixed on the bank,
and the blood allowed to drop into the stream, as an
offering to propitiate the spirits supposed to inhabit
the waters, and to insure that, at any rate, no accident
by water shall happen to the child. The remainder
of the fowl is taken back to the house and cooked and
eaten.</p>

<p>At some period after the child's birth&mdash;it may be
within a few weeks or it may be deferred for years&mdash;a
ceremony is gone through in which the gods and
spirits are invoked to grant the child health and
wealth and success in all his undertakings. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
ceremony is generally postponed for some years if the
parents are poor, in order to enable them to save a
little to pay for the entertainment of their friends
and relations on the occasion. Where the parents
are better off, the ceremony is held a few weeks after
the birth of the child. Several witch doctors are
asked to take part in this performance. A portion of
the long open hall of the Dyak house is screened off
by large hand-woven Dyak sheets, and within these
the mother sits with the child in her arms. The
witch doctors walk round and round singing an
incantation. Generally there is a leader who sings
by himself for a few minutes, then he pauses, and
turns round to his followers, and they all sing in
chorus. Then the leader sings by himself again, and
so on. They all walk round, first turning their feet
to the right, and stamping on the floor, then pausing
a moment, and turning their feet to the left, still
stamping. This ceremony begins in the evening and
goes on for several hours. When it is over, food is
brought out to the assembled guests, and all partake
of the provided feast.</p>

<p>The proceedings differ very much according to the
wealth and standing of the parents. Among the poor,
it is a very quiet affair&mdash;two or three witch doctors
attend, and only the near relatives of the child are
present. On the other hand, among those who are
rich, this ceremony is made the occasion of holding a
great feast, and inviting people from all parts to
attend. Pigs and fowls are killed for food. Jars of
<i>tuak</i> (a spirit obtained from rice) are brought forth for
the guests to drink, and all are invited to rejoice with
the parents.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>The naming of the child is not made the occasion
for any ceremonies, and it is not unusual to meet
children of seven or eight years old who have not yet
received a name. They are known by some pet name,
or are called <i>endun</i> (little girl) or <i>igat</i> or <i>anggat</i> (little
boy).</p>

<p>Even when a name is given to a child, it is often
changed for some reason or other. The Dyaks have a
great objection to uttering the name of a dead person,
so, if the namesake of a child dies, at once a new name
is chosen. Again, if the child be liable to frequent
attacks of illness, it is no uncommon thing for the
parents to change the name two or three times in the
course of a year. The reason for this is that all sickness
and death are supposed to be caused by evil
spirits, who are put off the scent by this means.
When they come to take the child's soul away, they
do not hear the old name uttered any more, and so
they conclude he no longer exists, and return without
him!</p>

<p>Dyak children do not have many toys. Little girls
are sometimes seen with rudely-carved wooden dolls,
and little boys play with models of boats. The
boys are fond of spinning tops, which they make
for themselves.</p>

<p>The Dyaks are very fond of children, and treat them
very kindly. They rarely if ever punish them. The
children have a great deal of liberty, but are not often
unruly, disobedient or disrespectful. They are generally
very fond of their parents, and when they grow
older, do as they are told from a desire to please them.</p>

<p>Dyak children have very soon to make themselves
useful. A little boy of ten or eleven accompanies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
his father to his work and helps him as best he can.
A boy is very proud when he has succeeded in making
his first dug-out canoe, which he sometimes does at
fifteen. I have often, when on a visit to a Dyak
village, been asked by some boy to see the first boat
he has made, and I have been shown, not a toy boat,
but a canoe in which three men could sit comfortably.</p>

<p>The girls like to help their mothers and learn to
become useful at an early age, and to do the different
kinds of work a woman is expected to do. When a
woman is plaiting a mat of split cane, or of reeds, she
often gives the short ends, which she has cut off, to
her little girl, who sits by her and tries to make a little
mat with them. I have often seen little girls of ten
and eleven being taught by their mothers how to
weave cloth.</p>

<p>It is sad to think of these Dyak children in Borneo
living in constant fear of evil spirits, and not knowing
anything about God. The missionaries try to teach
the little ones, and at each up-country Mission Station
there is a small school for Dyak boys. Here they are
taught about God, and are cut away from all the superstitious
customs which they would constantly see in
their Dyak homes. Many of these boys, after being
at school for a few years, return to their own people,
taking back with them the good lessons they have
learnt, and in many cases influencing their friends
and relatives for good, and leading some of them to
become Christians. A few of these schoolboys are sent
on to the larger school at the capital to be taught
English. These are the boys who, one hopes, will in
after years become teachers and catechists among
their own people. There are so few Dyak books that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
it is necessary that a Dyak teacher should learn
English in order to be able to educate himself by
reading English books.</p>

<br />
<small>MANNER OF LIFE&mdash;OCCUPATION</small></h2>


<p>The Dyaks are industrious and hard-working, and in
the busy times of paddy<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> planting they work from
early in the morning till dusk, only stopping for a meal
at midday. The division of labour between the men
and the women is a very reasonable one, and the
women do their fair share of work. The men do the
timber-felling, wood-cutting, clearing the land, house
and boat building, and the heavier work generally.
The women help in the lighter part of the farm work,
husk and pound the rice they eat, cook, weave, make
mats and baskets, fetch the water for their daily use
from the well or river, and attend to the children.</p>

<p>With regard to paddy<a name="FNanchor_2_B" id="FNanchor_2_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> planting on the hills, the work
is divided between the men and women in the following
manner. The men cut down the jungle where the
paddy is to be planted. When the timber and shrubs
have been burnt, the men and women plant the grain.
The roots and stumps of trees are left in the ground.
The men walk in front with a long heavy staff in the
right hand of each, and make holes in the ground,
about a foot apart. The women walk behind them
and throw a few grains of seed in each hole.</p>

<p>When the paddy has grown a little, the ground has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>to be carefully weeded; this work is done by the
women. When the crop is ripe, both men and women
do the reaping. They walk between the rows of
standing grain, and with a sharp, oddly-shaped little
knife, they cut off the heads one by one, and place
them in their baskets which are tied to their waists
in front of them. The carrying home of the paddy
thus reaped is mostly done by the men, who can carry
very heavy loads on their back, though the women
help in this work to some extent. The next thing is
to separate the grain from the little tiny stems to
which it is still attached. This is done by the men.
The grain is placed on a large square sieve of rattan
or cane, fixed between four posts in the verandah of the
Dyak house, and the men tread on it and press it through
the sieve. The paddy that falls through is taken and
stored in the loft in large round bins made of bark.</p>

<p>When rice is wanted for food, the paddy is dried in
the sun, and then pounded by the women in wooden
mortars with pestles five feet long. As a rule two or
three women each use their pestles at one mortar,
which is cut out of the trunk of a tree. I have seen as
many as six girls use their pestles in quick succession
at one mortar. In this way the grain is freed from
husk, and is made ready for food.</p>

<p>The Dyak marries at an early age, and lives in a long
village house with many other families, and does his
best to get as much paddy as possible each year. He
rises on work-days early in the morning, partakes of
his frugal meal of rice and salt, or rice and fish, varied
by a piece of wild pork or venison, which he may have
received as a gift or bought from some hunting friend.
His wife wraps up his midday meal for him in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
spathe of a Pinang palm, and he goes to his work of
cutting down the jungle for planting, returning home
in the evening.</p>

<p>There are days when he does not go to work on his
paddy farm, but spends his time in getting firewood,
or mending things in his room, or in sitting about in the
common verandah chatting with his friends.</p>

<p>When the paddy is planted and has grown a little,
and the time of weeding draws near, the family remove
to the little hut put up in the paddy farm. When the
weeding is done, the family return to the long Dyak
house and remain there for about two months. Then
they go back to their hut to watch the ripening paddy,
and guard it against attacks of birds and beasts.</p>

<p>Paddy planting is the chief occupation of every
Dyak, but he has plenty of time for other things, and
his life is not quite so monotonous as may be supposed.
The actual work of paddy planting, and everything
connected with it, such as the building of farm huts,
and the getting ready of farming implements, takes
up seven or perhaps eight months of the year. The
Dyak has therefore a certain amount of time during
which he can visit his friends, make boats, or earn a
little extra money by hunting for such jungle produce
as canes, gutta, or camphor.</p>

<p>The ordinary boats of the Dyaks are cut out of a
single log. Some of my schoolboys, under the guidance
of the native schoolmaster, once made a small
canoe for their own use, so I saw the whole process.
A tree having a long straight stem was felled, and the
desired length of trunk cut off. The outside was then
shaped to take the desired form of the canoe. Then
the inside was hollowed out. The next thing to do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>was to widen the inside of this canoe. This was done
by filling the boat with water and making a fire under
it, and by fastening large stone weights on each side.
When the shell had been sufficiently opened out,
thwarts were placed inside, about two feet from each
other, to prevent the boat getting out of shape when the
wood dried. The stem and stern of the canoe are
alike, both being curved and pointed, and rising out
of the water.</p>

<p>This is the usual type of Dyak boat, and the method
of making a smaller or larger canoe is exactly the same.
Even a war-boat, ninety feet long, is made from the
trunk of one tree. In the longer boats planks or gunwales
are stitched on the sides, and the seams are
caulked, so as to render the boat water-tight.</p>

<p>The only tool used for making a Dyak boat of this
kind is the Dyak axe or adze (<i>bliong</i>). This is a most
excellent tool, and is forged of European steel, which
they procure in bars. In shape it is like a small
spade, about two and a half inches wide, with a square
shank. This is set in a thin handle of hard wood, at
the end of which there is a woven pocket of cane to
receive it. The lower end of this handle has a piece
of light wood fixed to it to form a firm grip for the
hand. The <i>bliong</i> can be fixed in the handle at any
angle, and is therefore used as an axe or adze. With
it the Dyaks can cut down a great forest tree in a very
short time, and it is used for cutting planks and doing
their carpentering work.</p>

<p>While the work of the men is to build houses and to
make boats, the work of the women is to weave cloth
and make mats and baskets. The women plant their
own cotton, beat it out with small sticks, and by means
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>of a spinning-wheel make their own yarn. This yarn
is not so fine as that of English manufacture, but it is
stronger and keeps its colour well. At the present
time, however, a great deal of the cloth woven by the
Dyaks is done with yarn of English make. The warp
is arranged in the loom, and the weaver sits on the
floor and uses her hands and feet, the latter working
the treadles. The threads of the woof are then passed
backwards and forwards. The work is very slow, and
Dyak weaving very tedious. They use vegetable
dyes, and the women blend the colours in a pleasing
manner, though there is a great sameness in the
designs. The cloth they make is particularly strong
and serviceable.</p>

<p>Mats are made either with split cane or from the
outer bark of reeds. The women are very clever at
plaiting, and some of their mats are very fine in
texture. They also make baskets of different shapes
and sizes, some of which have coloured designs worked
into them.</p>

<br />
<small>HEAD-HUNTING</small></h2>


<p>The custom of head-hunting at one time prevailed
to a great extent among the Dyaks. In the old days
no Dyak chief of any standing could be married unless
he had been successful in obtaining the head of an
enemy. For this reason it was usual to make an
expedition into the enemy's country before the
marriage feast of any great chief. The head brought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>home need not be that of a man; the head of a woman
or child would serve the purpose quite as well.</p>

<p>There were certain ancient customs which necessitated
the possession of a human head. When any
person died, the relatives went into mourning. They
put away their ornaments and finery, and these were
tied together in bundles. At the feast in honour of the
dead, these bundles were all undone, and the men and
women were allowed to wear their ornaments again.
Some man cut the string with which they were tied
up, but before he could do such a thing, it was necessary
that a human head be brought into the house, and it
was usual for the man who had obtained that head to
take a leading part in the ceremonies and cut open the
bundles. It was also customary to make an offering
of a fresh human head to the spirits when a new village
house was to be built.</p>

<p>But these customs are not now universally observed.
At the feast in honour of the dead, the headman of the
house generally cuts open the bundles of finery that
have been put away, and at the building of a new
house, the killing of a pig is supposed to satisfy the
demands of the spirits.</p>

<p>It is presumed that a man, who has secured a human
head, must necessarily be brave. But this need not
be the case at all, for, as I have already mentioned, the
head may be that of a woman or child. Again, the
heads need not be obtained in open warfare. Very
often the head of an enemy is taken while he is asleep.
Nor is it necessary that a man kill his victim alone
with his own hand. Frequently many of his friends
help him to kill some unfortunate man whom they have
waylaid.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>In the old days an expedition, that one tribe intended
to take against another, was announced at one
of their feasts, when the village was thronged with
guests from far and near. Some great chief would
advance his reason for the desired attack. Either
some of his people had been slain and revenge was
called for, or else they required a human head to enable
them to put off their mourning. Or perhaps they
wished to build a new house, and required some human
heads to offer to the spirits of the earth. Or, possibly,
he himself wished to marry, and wanted a head as a
proof of his valour in the eyes of his lady-love. Among
the crowd who listened, there would be many who
wished to follow him on the war-path. The women
would urge their husbands, or lovers, or brothers to
go. The chief would choose a certain number to form
a council of war. These would discuss the matter,
and it would be decided when the party was to start
for the enemy's country, and how much food each man
was to take with him.</p>

<p>Then the War Spear would be sent round to the
neighbouring villages, to let all know of the expedition.
A man would bring the spear to a long Dyak village
house, deliver his message, and return, leaving the
spear to be carried on by one of the men in that house
to the next village, and so on. At once the men in
that house would get their war-boats ready. They
would furbish up their arms, and sharpen their
weapons, and decorate their helmets and war-jackets.</p>

<p>The costume a Dyak wears when going on the war-path,
consists of a basket-work cap, decorated with
feathers, and sometimes with human hair, a sleeveless
skin or cotton jacket, and the usual Dyak costume of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>the waistcloth. For weapons, he has a sword. This
may be of foreign or of their own make. It is a
dangerous weapon at close quarters. He also has a
spear consisting of a long wooden shaft of some hard
wood with a steel spear-head, which is tied on firmly
to the shaft with cane. For defensive purposes the
Dyak has a large wooden shield, about three feet
long, which, with its handle, is hollowed out of a single
block of wood. It is held in the left hand, well
advanced before the body, and meant not so much to
receive the spear-point, as to divert it by a twist of the
hand. It is generally painted in bright colours, and
often decorated with human hair.</p>

<p>Sometimes the shaft of the spear is a <i>sumpit</i> or blow-pipe.
This is a small wooden tube about eight feet
long. The smoothness and straightness of the bore
is remarkable. The hole is drilled with an iron rod,
one end of which is chisel-pointed, through a log of
hard wood, which is afterwards pared down and
rounded till it is about an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>The dart used with the <i>sumpit</i> is usually made of a
thin splinter of the <i>nibong</i> palm, stuck into a round
piece of very light wood, so as to afford a surface for
the breath to act upon. These darts are sharpened to
a fine point, and are carried in neatly-carved bamboo
quivers.</p>

<p>The poison for these darts is obtained from the
<i>ipoh</i> tree (upas). Though the wound made by the dart
is very slight, yet so potent and deadly is the poison,
that death follows in a very short time.</p>

<p>The Dyaks do not attack a village if their approach
has been discovered, and the people are on the defensive.
Under these circumstances, they content themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>with cutting off stragglers, or hide near the water-side
for people who are going to bathe, or on their way to
examine their fish-traps. These they attack unawares,
cut down, take their heads, and escape into the jungle
before the alarm is given.</p>

<p>When fighting, the Dyak warriors gather round their
chiefs and defend them bravely. Relatives often
cluster together for mutual help. When one of them
is killed, rather than allow the enemy to take his head,
they decapitate him themselves, and bring his head
back.</p>

<p>On the return from a war expedition, if the people
of any particular boat have secured a human head,
word is sent up to the Dyak village house, as soon as
the boat reaches the landing-stage. The men remain
in the boat, and wait there, till all the women-folk
come to it dressed in their best. The excitement is
great, and there are continual shouts of triumph as the
women, singing a monotonous chant, surround the
hero who has killed the enemy and lead him to the
house. He is seated in a place of honour, the head is
put on a brass tray before him, and all crowd round him
to hear his account of the battle, and how he succeeded
in killing one of his foes.</p>

<p class="caption">ON THE WARPATH</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Dyaks value very highly the heads taken in war.
They hang them over the fireplaces in the long open
verandahs of their houses, they make offerings to them,
and they believe that the souls of those whom they
have slain will be their slaves in the other world. I
look upon it as a remarkable fact worthy of record,
that two great Dyak chiefs, who became Christians&mdash;one
the Orang Kaya of Padih, Saribas, and the other,
Tarang of Krian&mdash;should have taken such a decided
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>step as to refuse to treasure their enemies' heads any
more. They were both men of position, with a great
reputation for bravery. Two of the grandchildren
of the Orang Kaya were at my school at Temudok
for some time. A son of Tarang, Tujoh by name,
worked as my Catechist in Krian for several years.
While so many Dyak Christians are most unwilling
to give up all their old heathen customs, these two
Christian Dyak chiefs happily took up the right
attitude, in such an important matter in the eyes of the
Dyaks as head-hunting.</p>

<br />
<small>BIRDS AND BEASTS IN BORNEO</small></h2>


<p>The animal life in Borneo is akin to that of Sumatra
and Java, but with certain differences. Borneo is free
from tigers, and this is fortunate, for travelling through
the jungles would be dangerous indeed if tigers were
likely to be encountered. The only wild animals to be
found are the small and comparatively harmless tree-tiger,
and the little brown honey-bear, but neither
of these are much feared. Wild boars abound, but
these never attack travellers, and are not a source of
danger.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of snakes, varying in size
from the python downwards. The python is a
dangerous animal, and can kill a deer or a wild pig,
and swallow it whole. After a meal of that kind, a
python is unable to move for several days.</p>

<p>Monkeys of various kinds abound, and are often seen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>among the branches, sitting, hanging by hands or
tails, leaping, grimacing, jabbering. There is the
great man-like ape&mdash;the <i>orang-utan</i>, or <i>maias</i> as he is
called by the Dyaks. As a rule this animal does not
exceed the height of four feet two inches, though
there are stories told of its attaining a far greater size.
The height, however, gives a poor idea of the animal's
bulk and strength. The body is as large as that of an
average man, but the legs are extremely short. Its
arms are of great length, and measure over seven feet
in spread. The whole body is covered with long red
hair. It rarely attacks man, but when provoked is
very ferocious, and as its strength is very great, it is
a foe not to be despised.</p>

<p>Ferocious crocodiles abound in the rivers, but the
number of human lives taken by them is not great.
For the most part crocodiles live upon the animals
and fish they catch.</p>

<p>For superstitious reasons, the Dyaks do not interfere
with the crocodile until he has shown some sign
of his man-eating propensity. If the crocodile will live
at peace with him, the Dyak has no wish to start a
quarrel. If, however, the crocodile breaks the truce
and kills someone, then the Dyaks set to work to kill
the culprit, and keep on catching and killing crocodiles
until they find him. The Dyaks generally wear brass
ornaments, and by cutting open a dead crocodile,
they can easily find out if he is the creature they wish
to punish. Sometimes as many as ten crocodiles are
killed before they manage to destroy the animal they
want.</p>

<p>Wild pig and deer are to be found in the jungles,
and these are often hunted by the Dyaks. The Dyaks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>subsist more on a vegetable and fish diet than on an
animal diet, so hunting with them is only an occasional
pursuit. A Dyak village swarms with dogs, but
most of these are of no use for the chase, and only
prowl about the premises, and consume the refuse
food. But some of their dogs, though small in size,
are plucky little animals, and will attack a boar three
or four times their size. Such dogs are of great value
to the few Dyaks in each village who care for hunting.
When the dogs are good and know their work, native
hunting is not difficult. The hunter loiters about, and
the dogs beat the jungle for themselves, and when they
have found a scent, give tongue, and soon run the
animal to bay. The hunter knows this by their peculiar
bark, hurries to the spot and spears the game. The
boars are sometimes very dangerous when wounded,
and turn furiously on the hunter, and unless he is
nimble and climbs up some tree near at hand, or is
assisted by his dogs, he might fare ill in spite of his
sword and spear. The dogs are very useful, and by
attacking the hind legs of the animal keep making
him turn round.</p>

<p>Deer are more easily run down than pigs, because
they have not the strength to go any great distance,
especially in the hot weather.</p>

<p>A favourite way of catching deer is to send a man
to follow the spoor of a deer, and to find out where it
lies to rest during the heat of the day. Then large
nets, made of fine cane, are hung around, and the deer
is driven into these. The hunting party divide
into two parties, some to watch the net, the others,
accompanied by a large crowd of women and children,
drive the deer towards it by yelling and shouting.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>The startled deer springs from its covert and makes
towards the forest, and gets entangled in the meshes
of the net. Before it can extricate itself, it is killed
by the watchers.</p>

<p>Lizards of all sizes abound. There is a small
lizard which is seen on the walls and ceilings as soon
as the lamps are lit. It eats up any mosquitoes or
moths that it can find. What happens to this animal
in the daytime, I do not know, but as soon as the lamps
are lit several of them always make their appearance.</p>

<p>There is a large lizard, about a foot long, found
sometimes in the Dyak houses. It makes a loud
uncanny sound at night, and cries "<i>Gok-ko</i>!" at
intervals. This animal is named after its cry, and is
called by the Dyaks "<i>Gok-ko</i>." The natives consider
that these lizards bring good luck, and portend good
harvests, so they never kill them.</p>

<p>Many other kinds of lizards are found, but the most
remarkable is the chameleon, which is often seen on
the branches of trees. This animal can change its
colour. When in the sun, it is generally a bright green,
in the shade, it is brown in colour, and when dead, its
body becomes quite black. These are the principal
colours of the animal, but often its body is a combination
of these colours, and it looks very beautiful.</p>

<p>Of birds there are to be found many varieties of
wood-pigeon, as well as parrots of different kinds,
which fly about in large flocks. There are also tiny
humming-birds with feathers of a bright metallic hue.
These look very pretty as they hover over flowers.</p>

<p>Many other birds are also found in the jungles of
Borneo. Some of these are looked upon by the Dyaks
as the agents of the gods and spirits, and they pay
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>great heed to their cries. The Dyaks know nothing of
the God of Love who cares for His children, and has
sent His Son Jesus Christ to earth to tell us how to
live, and so they listen to the voices of these omen
birds, and think that by doing so, they can find out
the will of the higher powers.</p>

<h2><a name="Chap_VIII" id="Chap_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<br />
<small>SOME CURIOUS CUSTOMS</small></h2>


<p>There are many curious customs to be met with among
the Dyaks of Borneo. They have the trial by ordeal,
by diving, in which two men keep their heads under
water as long as they can. This is their way of referring
disputed questions to supernatural decision. They
believe that the gods are sure to help the innocent,
and punish the guilty. When there is a dispute between
two parties, in which it is impossible to obtain
reliable evidence, or where one of the parties is not
satisfied with the decision of the headman of the Dyak
house, this ordeal is often resorted to.</p>

<p>Several preliminary meetings are held by the representatives
of both parties to decide the time, and the
place of the match. It is also decided what property
each party should stake. This has to be paid by the
loser to the victor.</p>

<p>For several days and nights before the contest, they
gather their friends together; they make offerings
and sing incantations to the spirits, and beg of them
to support their just cause, and help their representative
to win. Each party chooses a champion. There
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>are many professional divers, who, for a trifling sum,
are willing to take part in this painful contest.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day previous to that on which
the diving match is to take place, each champion is fed
with seven compressed balls of cooked rice. Then
each is made to lie down on a nice new mat, and is
covered with a beautiful, Dyak-woven sheet; an
incantation is made over him, and the spirit inhabitants
of the waters are invoked to come to the aid of the
man whose cause is just.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the champions are roused
from their sleep, and dressed each in a fine new
waistcloth. The articles staked are brought down
from the houses, and placed upon the bank. A large
crowd of men, women and children join the procession
of the two champions and their friends and supporters
to the scene of the contest at the river-side. As soon
as the place is reached, fires are lit and mats are spread
for the divers to sit on and warm themselves. While
they sit by their respective fires, the necessary preparations
are made.</p>

<p>Each party provides a roughly-constructed wooden
grating, to be placed in the bed of the river, for his
champion to stand on in the water. These are placed
within a few yards of each other, where the water
is deep enough to reach the waist, and near each a
pole is thrust firmly into the mud for the man to hold
on to while he is diving.</p>

<p>The two divers are led into the river, and each
stands on his own grating, grasping his pole. At a
given signal they plunge their heads simultaneously
into the water. Immediately the spectators shout
aloud at the top of their voices, over and over again,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>"<i>Lobon&mdash;lobon</i>," and continue doing so during the
whole contest. What these mysterious words mean,
I have never been able to discover. When at length
one of the champions shows signs of yielding, by his
movements in the water, and the shaking of the pole
he is holding to, the excitement becomes very great.
"<i>Lobon&mdash;lobon</i>," is shouted louder and more rapidly
than before. The shouts become deafening. The
struggles of the poor victim, who is fast losing consciousness,
are painful to witness. The champions
are generally plucky, and seldom come out of the water
of their own will. They stay under water until the
loser drops senseless, and is dragged ashore, apparently
lifeless, by his companions. The friends of the winner,
raising a loud shout of triumph, hurry to the bank
and seize and carry off the stakes. The vanquished
one, quite unconscious, is carried by his friends to the
fire, where he is warmed. In a few minutes he recovers,
opens his eyes and gazes wildly around, and in a short
time is able to walk slowly home. Where both
champions succumb at the same time, the one who first
regains his senses is held to be the winner.</p>

<p>The Dyaks have a curious superstition that if food
is offered to a man, and he refuses it, and goes away
without at least touching it, some misfortune is sure
to befall him. It is said that he is sure to be either
attacked by a crocodile, or bitten by a snake, or suffer
from the attack of some animal.</p>

<p>When Dyaks have been asked to stay and have a
meal, if they do not feel inclined to do so, I have often
noticed them touch the food before going away. I
have never been able to discover the origin of this
curious superstition, but innumerable tales are told
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>of those who have disregarded it, and have paid the
penalty by being attacked by some animal.</p>

<p>The Dyaks are very truthful. So disgraceful
indeed do the Dyaks consider the deceiving of others
by an untruth, that such conduct is handed down to
posterity by a remarkable custom. They heap up a
pile of the branches of trees in memory of the man who
has told a great lie, so that future generations may
know of his wickedness, and take warning from it.
The persons deceived start the <i>tugong bula</i>&mdash;"the
liar's mound"&mdash;by heaping up a large number of
branches in some conspicuous spot by the side of the
path from one village to another. Every passer-by
contributes to it, and at the same time curses the
man in memory of whom it is. The Dyaks consider
the adding to any <i>tugong bula</i> they may pass a sacred
duty, the omission of which will meet with supernatural
punishment, and so, however pressed for time
a Dyak may be, he stops to throw on the pile some
small branch or twig.</p>

<p>A few branches, a few dry twigs and leaves&mdash;that is
what the <i>tugong bula</i> is at first. But day by day it
increases in size. Every passer-by adds to it, and in
a few years' time it becomes an imposing memorial to
one who was a liar. Once started, there seems to be
no means of destroying a <i>tugong bula</i>. There used to
be one by the side of the path between Seratok and
Sebetan. As the branches and twigs that composed it
often came over the path, on a hot day in the dry
weather, I have more than once applied a match to it
and burnt it down. However, in a very short time,
a new heap of branches and twigs was piled on the
ashes of the old <i>tugong bula</i>.</p>

<small>DYAK FEASTS</small></h2>


<p>The Dyak religious feasts may be divided into the
four following classes:&mdash;</p>

<p>Those connected with&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">1. Head-taking.</p>

<p class="indent">2. Farming.</p>

<p class="indent">3. The Dead.</p>

<p class="indent">4. Dreams, etc.</p>

<p>Though the Dyak feasts differ in their aims, there
is a great deal which is common to them all. In these
feasts the religious aspect does not seem of great
importance. There is little real, reverential worship
of gods or spirits. It is true that food is offered to some
higher powers, but this is done as the mere observance
of an ancient custom. There are also long incantations
made by men chosen for that purpose, who have good
memories and can recite in a monotonous chant the
special hymns of great length connected with each
feast. But the guests do not share in this as an act
of religious worship. They are generally sitting round,
talking, and laughing, and eating. While these
incantations are sung, topics of common interest are
discussed, and plans formed, and in all Dyak feasts,
sociability and the partaking of food and drink seem to
take a more prominent place than any religious worship.</p>

<p>The preparations for all these feasts are much alike.
They extend over a length of time, and consist for the
most part in the procuring of food for the guests.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>The young men go to their friends, far and near, and
obtain from them presents of pigs or fowls for the feast,
and as cock-fighting is loved by the Dyaks, they at the
same time procure as many fighting cocks as possible.
The women busy themselves with pounding out an
extra amount of rice, both for the consumption of the
guests, and also for the making of <i>tuak</i> or native spirit.</p>

<p>The special characteristics and religious aspects of
these different feasts must now be noticed.</p>

<p>1. <i>Feasts connected with Head-taking.</i> All these
are given in honour of Singalang Burong, who is the
ruler of the spirit-world, and the god of war. These
feasts are not held as frequently as those connected
with farming, but when any of them take place, a
great deal is made of the event. The most important
is the <i>Bird Feast</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Bird Feast</i>. This feast is also called the <i>Head
Feast</i>, because part of the ceremony connected with
it is the giving of food to some human heads taken in
war, or the <i>Horn-bill Feast</i>, because carved figures of
the horn-bill are used. It lasts three days whereas
other feasts only last one day. In the old days it was
only held on the return from a successful war expedition,
when the heads of the enemy were brought home
in triumph. But in the present day this feast is
organized when they get a good harvest, and when the
people of the Dyak house seem so inclined, and if no
new heads have been lately brought home as trophies,
some old smoked heads that have been in the house
for years are used.</p>

<p>Among the preparations for this feast is the making
of the carved wooden figure of the rhinoceros' horn-bill.
This wooden figure is set on a high pole, which is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>fixed into the ground in front of the house. An offering
of Dyak delicacies is hung up under it for food.
Sometimes several of these figures are used.</p>

<p>Some human heads are placed in large brass dishes
in the public hall of the Dyak house, and to these
offerings of food and drink are made. Some of the
food is stuffed into the mouths of these heads, and the
rest is placed before them.</p>

<p>There are also certain erections called <i>pandong</i> put
up at regular intervals in the long public hall, and to
these are hung war-charms, swords and spears, etc.
The men who are chosen to make the incantations walk
up and down, going round the <i>pandong</i> and the heads
in the brass dishes, singing the particular incantation
that is used at this feast. This singing lasts the whole
night, beginning at 8 <small>P.M.</small> and continuing till the
following morning. Except for a short interval for
rest in the middle of the night, the performers are
marching and singing all the time. The killing of a
pig, and examining the liver to find out whether good
or bad fortune is in store for them, is the last act of the
ceremony.</p>

<p>2. The principal feast connected with <i>Farming</i> is
the <i>Gawai Batu</i> (the "Stone Feast"). It takes place
before the farming operations begin, and is held in
honour of Pulang Gana, the god of the land, who lives
in the bowels of the earth, and has power to make the
land fruitful or unfruitful. In this feast invocations
are made to this god, and he is asked to give them a
good harvest. The whetstones and farming implements
are placed in a heap in the public part of the
Dyak house. Offerings are made to the whetstones
with a request that they may sharpen the tools and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>thus lighten the labours of their owners. After the
feast is over, the whetstones are taken to the different
farms, and the work of cutting down the jungle for
planting begins.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Great Feast connected with the Dead</i> is the
<i>Gawai Antu</i> (the "Spirit Feast"). No definite time
is fixed for the celebration of this, and it may be held
one or two years after the death of a person. All
those that have died since the last time the feast was
held, are honoured at the same time, so that the number
of departed spirits remembered at this feast is sometimes
great.</p>

<p>The preparation for this feast is carried on for many
weeks. Distant friends and relatives are visited, and
asked to help with gifts of food or money. Hard wood
memorial monuments for the graves are got ready by
the men. The women weave, with finely-split bamboo,
small imitations of various articles of personal and
domestic use, and those are hung over the graves, and
in this way given to the dead for their use in the other
world. If the dead person be a man, a bamboo gun,
a shield, a war-cap and such things are woven; if a
woman, a loom, a fish-basket, a winnowing fan, etc.;
if a child, bamboo toys of various kinds.</p>

<p>Before the feasting begins in the evening, there takes
place the formal putting off of mourning. The nearest
male relative of the dead person in whose honour the
feast is held, comes dressed in an old and shabby
waist cloth. This is cut through by some chief,
and the man puts on a better garment. In the case
of female relatives, also, their old shabby garments are
cut through and thrown aside, and they resume the
use of bright clothing and personal ornaments. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>bundles containing finery, that were put away at the
death of their relative, are brought forth, and the
string tying them cut through, and the owners put on
their bright garments again. As the feast is in honour
of several who have died since the feast was last held,
this kind of thing goes on in several of the rooms at
the same time.</p>

<p>The professional wailer sits on a swing in the
verandah outside the rooms, and in a monotonous
voice invites all the spirits of the dead to attend this
feast given in their honour.</p>

<p>The morning after the feast, the last duty to
the dead is performed. The wooden monuments,
the bamboo imitation articles, and food of all
kinds are arranged upon the different graves.
Having received these gifts, the dead relinquish
all claim upon the living, and depend on their own
resources.</p>

<p>4. A superstitious people like the Dyaks, living in
constant dread of unseen powers, naturally hold a
feast when anything unusual takes place. As the
gods and spirits are supposed to communicate their
wishes to human beings by means of dreams, it
naturally follows that if a man dreams that some
spirit is hungry and asks for food, at once a feast is
held, and offerings are made to that spirit. As the
omens of birds are observed and obeyed by the Dyaks,
and the omen birds are looked upon as messengers
of the great god Singalang Burong, when a bird of
ill omen comes into a Dyak house, a feast is held, and
offerings are made to the gods and spirits. When a
man has recovered from a long and dangerous illness,
very often a feast is held to thank the spirit of disease
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>for leaving them, and to beg him to stay away a long
time.</p>

<p>To all these feasts the whole neighbourhood for
miles around are invited. Some weeks before the day
appointed for the feast, small parties of three or four
are despatched in different directions, and these go
from house to house and invite people to the feast.</p>

<p>The men and women come to a feast dressed in
the brightest colours and wearing many ornaments,
and the whole assembly has a very gay appearance.
For amusements they have dancing, cock-fighting,
and trials of strength among the young men.</p>

<p>The Dyaks have two dances&mdash;the <i>Mencha</i> or Sword
Dance, and the <i>Ajat</i> or War Dance. In the former,
two swords are placed on a mat, and two men begin
slowly from the opposite ends turning their bodies
about, extending the arms, and lifting their feet and
planting them down in grotesque but not ungraceful
attitudes. After moving about for some minutes,
they seize the swords and pass and repass each other,
now cutting, now crossing swords, retiring and advancing.
The main idea of this Sword Dance seems to be
the posturing in different attitudes, and not so much
the skill displayed in fencing. I have often watched
a Dyak Sword Dance, where neither has touched the
other with his sword, the movements having been so
leisurely that there has been plenty of time to ward off
each attack.</p>

<div class="cap-vert">
<p class="caption">A DYAK GIRL IN GALA COSTUME</p>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>Ajat</i> or War Dance is danced by one man. He
is generally fully armed with sword, spear and shield.
He acts in pantomime what is done when on the war-path.
The dancer begins by imitating the creeping
through the jungle in cautious manner, looking to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>right and to the left, before and behind, for the foe.
The lurking enemy is suddenly discovered, and after
some rapid attack and defence, a sudden plunge is
made upon him, and he lies dead on the ground. The
taking of the head of this invisible enemy ends the
dance. Both kinds of dancing are accompanied by
the striking of brass gongs and drums.</p>

<p>Cock-fighting is a favourite sport, and there is a
great deal of it at all Dyak forests. The cocks have
artificial steel spurs which are very sharp.</p>

<br />
<small>THE WITCH DOCTOR</small></h2>


<p>The children of Borneo are taught from their earliest
years that there are evil spirits everywhere&mdash;in the
air, in the trees, in the rocks and in the streams&mdash;and
that these cause disease and death. And so when
sickness comes, the witch doctor or <i>Manang</i> is sent for,
because he claims to have mysterious powers over the
spirits.</p>

<p>Every disease is believed to be caused by the touch
of some demon, who wishes to carry off the soul of the
sick man into the other world, and the witch doctor
is the man who has power to charm or kill the evil
spirit, and rescue the soul of the sick man from his
cruel clutches. When called in to attend a patient,
he in company with other medicine men go through a
ceremony, which, though agreeing in the main points,
differs in details according to what the disease is, and
the amount of fees paid.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>The witch doctor always possesses a <i>lupong</i> or
medicine box, generally made of bark skin, which is
filled with charms, consisting of scraps of wood or
bark, curiously twisted roots, pebbles and fragments
of quartz. These charms are either inherited or revealed
to their owners by the spirits in dreams, as
possessing medicinal virtue. One important and
necessary charm is the <i>Batu Ilau</i>&mdash;"stone of light"&mdash;a
bit of quartz crystal into which the witch doctor
looks in order to see the soul, so as to be able to catch
it and bring it back to the body it has left. It is
believed by the Dyaks that in all cases of serious
sickness, the soul leaves the body and wanders about
at greater or less distance from it; if it can be caught
before it has proceeded too far on its journey to the
other world, well and good; if not, the patient dies.
Whether the patient recover or not, the witch doctor
is rewarded for his services. He makes sure of this
beforehand, and demands his fee before he undertakes
the case.</p>

<p>The <i>Manang</i> never carries his own box of charms;
the people who fetch him must carry it for him. He
arrives at the house of the sick man generally at sunset,
for he never performs by daylight, unless the case
is very serious, and he is paid extra for doing so. It is
difficult and dangerous work, he says, to have any
dealings with the spirits in the daytime. Sitting down
by the patient, after some inquiries, he produces out
of his medicine box a pebble, or a boar's tusk, or some
other charm, and gently strokes the body with it. If
there be several medicine men called in, the leader
undertakes the preliminary examination, the rest
giving their assent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>The witch doctor now produces his <i>Batu Ilau</i>
("stone of light") and gravely looks into it to see
where the soul is, and to discover what is the proper
ceremony for the case. When there is serious illness,
the witch doctor affirms that the spirit of the afflicted
person has already left the body and is on its way to the
other world, but that he may be able to overtake it
and bring it back, and restore it to the person to whom
it belongs. He pretends to converse with the evil
spirit that troubles the sick man, repeating aloud the
answers that the spirit is supposed to make.</p>

<p>There are many different ceremonies resorted to in
cases of illness, but the following is what is common
to all <i>Manang</i> performances.</p>

<p>In the public hall of the Dyak house, a long-handled
spear is fixed blade upwards, with a few leaves tied
round it, and at its foot are placed the medicine boxes
of all the witch doctors who take part in the ceremony.
This is called the <i>Pagar Api</i> ("fence of fire"). Why
it is called by this curious name is not clear.</p>

<p>The <i>Manangs</i> all squat on the floor, and the leader
begins a long monotonous drawl, the rest either
singing in concert, or joining in the choruses, or singing
in turn with him. After a tiresome period of this,
they stand up and march with slow and solemn step
in single file round the <i>Pagar Api</i>. The monotonous
chant sometimes slackens, sometimes quickens, as
they march round and round the whole night through,
with only one interval for food in the middle of the
night. The patient simply lies on his mat and listens.</p>

<p>Most of what is chanted consists of meaningless
sounds, it being supposed that what is not understood
by man is intelligible to the spirits. But some parts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>of it can be understood by the careful listener. The
witch doctors call upon the sickness to be off to the
ends of the earth and return to the unseen regions
from whence it came. They invoke the aid of spirits,
as well as their own ancestors, and spin out the invocation
to last till early morning. Then they rush round
the <i>Pagar Api</i> as hard as they can go, still singing
their incantation. One of their number suddenly
falls on the floor and lies motionless. The others sit
down round him. He is covered over with a blanket,
and all wait, while his spirit is supposed to hurry away
to the other world to find the wandering soul and bring
it back. Presently he revives, and looks vacantly
round like a man just waking out of sleep. Then he
raises his right hand clenched as if holding something.
That hand contains the soul, and he proceeds to the
patient, and solemnly returns it to the body of the
sick man through the crown of his head. This
"catching of the soul" is the great end to which all
that has preceded leads up. One more thing must be
done to complete the cure. A live fowl must be waved
over the patient, and as he does so, the leader sings
a special invocation of great length. The animal is
afterwards killed as an offering to the spirits, and
eaten by the <i>Manangs</i>.</p>

<p>The witch doctor is supposed to be called to his
profession by a revelation made to him in a dream by
some spirit. He therefore claims to have a familiar
spirit, whom he can call to his aid when necessary.
He must also commit to memory a certain amount
of Dyak incantations to take part in the ceremonies in
company with other <i>Manangs</i>. In addition to this,
before he can accomplish the more important feats
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>such as pretending to catch the soul of a sick man,
he must be initiated by other witch doctors. There
are three different grades of <i>Manangs</i>, and the higher
the grade is, the larger the fees the aspirant has to pay
the other witch doctors. There are some differences in
the ceremonies connected with the admission into each
of these three grades, but in all of them the aspirant
sits in the verandah of the Dyak house, and a number
of witch doctors walk round him singing incantations
during the whole night. The other <i>Manangs</i> pretend
to endow him with mysterious powers, and to make
him able to "touch" the maladies of the body, and
also to see the soul wherever it may be wandering.</p>

<p>From what has been said it will be seen that the
Dyak witch doctor uses much deceit and trades on the
ignorance of others. He pretends to be able to
"catch the soul" of a sick man, and is paid for doing
so. When Dyaks have given up their old beliefs and
superstitions, and have accepted the true Faith, they
naturally give up their belief in the witch doctor's
mysterious powers. For this reason the greatest
opponents to the advance of the Gospel in Borneo are
the <i>Manangs</i>. I am glad to say, however, that some
Dyak witch doctors have listened to the teaching of
the missionaries and have seen the wickedness of the
deceitful lives they have led. These have become
Christians, and have openly confessed to their evil
practices in trading on the superstitions of the Dyaks.
Some have become Catechists and teachers, and are
teaching others to renounce the belief in evil spirits
which they at one time taught, and are undoing the
evil they did in the past by bringing people to
God.</p>

<br />
<small>SOME ANIMAL STORIES</small></h2>


<p>The Dyaks of Borneo, both young and old, are very
fond of listening to stories, and often in the evening in
the public hall of the long Dyak village house, a crowd
of men, women and children may be seen seated on
mats, listening to a legend or fairy-tale related by some
old man. They have a large number of stories about
animals which the Dyaks are never tired of listening
to; and though they know them well, still they love
to hear them retold again and again. These animal
stories correspond to the adventures of Brer Rabbit,
or our own tales illustrating the cunning of the fox.
In the Dyak stories the mouse-deer, one of the smallest
animals to be found in Borneo, is represented as very
clever, and able to outwit with his cunning the larger
and stronger animals. Here are two animal stories
which I have myself heard related by the Dyaks
themselves:</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of the Mouse-deer and other Animals
who went out Fishing</span></h3>

<p>Once upon a time the Mouse-deer, accompanied by
many other animals, went on a fishing expedition.
All day long they fished, and in the evening they
returned to the little hut they had put up by the river-side,
salted the fish they had caught, and stored it up
in large jars. They noticed, when they returned in
the evening, that much of the fish they had left in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>morning was missing. The animals held a council to
decide what it was best to do, and after some discussion,
it was decided that the Deer should stay
behind to catch the thief, while the others went out
to fish.</p>

<p>"I shall be able to master him, whoever he is,"
said the Deer. "If he refuses to do what I wish, I
shall punish him with my sharp horns."</p>

<p>So the others went out fishing, leaving the Deer at
home. Soon he heard the tramp of someone coming
to the foot of the ladder leading up into the hut, and
a voice called out:</p>

<p>"Is anyone at home?"</p>

<p>"I am here," said the Deer. Looking out he saw a
great giant, and his heart failed him. He wished he
had asked one of his companions to stay with him.</p>

<p>"I smell some fish," said the Giant. "I want
some, and you must give it to me at once. I am
hungry. Let me have what I want."</p>

<p>"It does not belong to me," said the Deer, in great
fear. "It belongs to the Pig, the Bear, the Tiger,
and the Mouse-deer. They would punish me severely
if I gave any of it to you."</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me in that way," said the Giant,
impatiently. "If you do not let me have what I
want, I will eat you up."</p>

<p>The Deer was too frightened of the Giant to refuse
his request, so he let him eat the fish, and take some
away with him.</p>

<p>When his companions returned, the Deer gave them
his account of the Giant's visit. They blamed him
for his cowardice, and the Wild Boar said he would
keep watch the next day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>"If the Giant comes," said he, "I will gore him
with my tusks, and trample him underfoot."</p>

<p>But he fared no better than the Deer, for when he
saw the Giant, who threatened to kill him if he refused
to give him some fish, he was afraid, and let him take
as much as he wanted.</p>

<p>Great was the disgust of the others to find on their
return that their fish had again been taken.</p>

<p>"Let me watch," said the Bear. "No Giant shall
frighten me. I will hug him with my strong arms, and
scratch him with my sharp claws."</p>

<p>So Bruin was left in charge the next day, while the
others went out to fish.</p>

<p>Soon he heard the Giant who came to the foot of the
steps, and shouted: "Hullo! Who's there?"</p>

<p>"I am," said the Bear. "Who are you, and what
do you want?"</p>

<p>"I can smell some nice fish, and I am hungry, and
want some."</p>

<p>"I cannot let you have any," said the Bear. "It
does not belong to me."</p>

<p>"Let me have some at once," said the Giant in a
voice of thunder, "before I kill and eat you."</p>

<p>The Bear was too much frightened to interfere,
while the Giant ransacked the jars. When he had had
enough, he bade the Bear "Good-bye!" and went
off.</p>

<p>On the return of the other animals, the Tiger said
he would put a stop to this state of things. He would
stay at home the next day and keep watch. It would
have to be a very strong Giant indeed that would
dare to fight him!</p>

<p>The Giant paid his visit as before, and told the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>Tiger that he was hungry, and asked for some fish.
At first the Tiger refused to give any to him, but when
the Giant threatened to attack him, he was afraid,
like the others had been, and let him have as much as
he wanted.</p>

<p>On their return, again the animals found their fish
had been stolen.</p>

<p>Then the Mouse-deer spoke. "I see," he said,
"that it is no use depending on you others. You
boast, but when the time comes for action, you have
no courage. I will stay at home, and secure this
giant of whom you are all afraid."</p>

<p>When his companions had gone away the next
morning, the Mouse-deer tied a bandage round his
forehead and lay down.</p>

<p>Soon the Giant came, and shouted: "Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Only me," said the Mouse-deer, groaning with
pain. "Come up, whoever you may be."</p>

<p>The Giant climbed up the rickety ladder, and saw
the Mouse-deer lying with his head bandaged.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?" asked the Giant.</p>

<p>"I have a headache," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Whatever has given you the headache?" asked
the Giant.</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?" said the Mouse-deer. "It
is the smell of this fish in these jars. It is so strong,
it is enough to make anyone ill. Don't you feel ill
yourself?"</p>

<p>"I think I do," said the Giant. "Cannot you give
me some medicine?"</p>

<p>"I have no medicine with me," said the Mouse-deer,
"but I can bandage you, as I have bandaged myself,
and that is sure to do you good."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>"Thank you," said the Giant. "It is good of you
to take the trouble to cure me."</p>

<p>So the Giant lay down as he was bid, while the
Mouse-deer bandaged his head and fastened the ends
of the bandage to pegs which he drove into the ground
under the open flooring of the hut.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel a little pain in your ankles?"
anxiously suggested the Mouse-deer.</p>

<p>"I think I do," said the foolish giant. "Suppose
you bandage them also."</p>

<p>So the Mouse-deer, chuckling to himself, bandaged
his ankles, and made them fast to the floor of the
hut.</p>

<p>"Do you not feel the pain in your legs?" asked
the Mouse-deer.</p>

<p>"I think I do," was the foolish Giant's reply.</p>

<p>So the Mouse-deer bandaged his legs and made
them secure, so that the Giant was quite unable to
move.</p>

<p>By this time the Giant began to get uneasy, and
trying to get up, and finding himself securely bound,
he struggled, and roared in pain and anger.</p>

<p>The little Mouse-deer sat before him and laughed,
and said:</p>

<p>"You were a match for the Deer, the Pig, the Bear,
and the Tiger, but you are defeated by me. Don't
make so much noise, or I shall drive a peg through
your temples and kill you."</p>

<p>Just then the others returned from their fishing.
Great was their joy to find their enemy securely
bound. With shouts of triumph they fell upon the
Giant and killed him, and praised the Mouse-deer
for his cleverness in securing him.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of the Mouse-deer, the Deer, and
the Pig</span></h3>

<p>A Mouse-deer, wandering in the jungle, fell into a pit.
He could not get out, so he waited patiently for some
passer-by. Presently a Pig passed by the mouth of
the pit. The Mouse-deer called out to him, and he
looked in and asked the Mouse-deer what he was doing
at the bottom of the pit.</p>

<p>"Don't you know what is going to happen?" said
the Mouse-deer. "The sky is going to fall down,
and everybody will be crushed to dust unless he takes
shelter in a pit. If you want to save your life, you had
better jump in."</p>

<p>The Pig jumped into the pit, and the Mouse-deer
got on his back, but he found he was not high enough
to enable him to leap out.</p>

<p>Next a Deer came along, and, seeing the two animals
in the pit, asked them what they were doing there.</p>

<p>The Mouse-deer replied: "The sky is going to fall
down, and everyone will be crushed unless he hides in
some hole. Jump in, if you want to save your life."</p>

<p>The Deer sprang in, and the Mouse-deer made him
stand on the back of the Pig; then he himself got
on the back of the Deer and jumped out of the pit,
leaving the other two to their fate.</p>

<p>The Deer and the Pig were very angry at being
tricked in this way by such a small animal as the
Mouse-deer. They scratched the side of the pit
with their feet until it sloped, and enabled them to
scramble out; then they followed the trail of the
Mouse-deer, and soon overtook him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>The Mouse-deer saw them coming, and climbed
up a tree from the bough of which a large beehive
was hanging.</p>

<p>"Come down," said the Pig and Deer angrily.
"You have deceived us, and we mean to kill
you."</p>

<p>"Deceived you?" said the Mouse-deer in pretended
surprise. "When did I deceive you, or do anything
to deserve death?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell us that the sky was going to fall,
and that if we did not hide ourselves in a pit we should
be killed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," was the reply. "What I said was
perfectly true, only I persuaded the King to postpone
the disaster."</p>

<p>"You need not try to put us off with any more
lies. You must come down, for we mean to have your
blood."</p>

<p>"I cannot," said the Mouse-deer, "because the
King has asked me to watch his gong," pointing to
the bees' nest.</p>

<p>"Is that the King's gong?" said the Deer. "I
should like to strike it to hear what it sounds
like."</p>

<p>"So you may," said the Mouse-deer, "only let me
get down, and go to some distance before you do so,
as the sound would deafen me."</p>

<p>So the Mouse-deer sprang down and ran away.
The Deer took a long stick and struck the bees' nest,
and the bees flew out angrily and stung him to
death.</p>

<p>The Pig, seeing what had happened, pursued the
Mouse-deer, determined to avenge the death of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>friend. He found his enemy taking refuge on a tree
round the trunk of which a large python was
curled.</p>

<p>"Come down," said the Pig, "and I will kill you."</p>

<p>"I cannot come down to-day. I am set here to
watch the King's girdle. Look at it," he said,
pointing to the Python. "Is it not pretty? I
have never seen such a handsome waist-belt
before."</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," said the Pig. "How I should
like to wear it for one day!"</p>

<p>"So you may," said the Mouse-deer, "but be
careful and do not spoil it."</p>

<p>So the foolish Pig entangled himself in the folds
of the Python, who soon crushed him to death and
ate him for his dinner, and the clever Mouse-deer
escaped, having outwitted his enemies.</p>

<h2><a name="Chap_XII" id="Chap_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
<br />
<small>OMENS AND DREAMS</small></h2>


<p>The Dyak is conscious of his ignorance of the laws
which govern the world in which he lives. He feels
his weakness and the need of some guidance from
unseen powers. He has no knowledge of God and the
revelation He has made in the Bible, and so he has
devised for himself a system of omens.</p>

<p>There are seven birds in Borneo whose native
names are: <i>Katupong</i>, <i>Beragai</i>, <i>Kutok</i>, <i>Embuas</i>,
<i>Nendak</i>, <i>Papau</i> and <i>Bejampong</i>. These are supposed
to reveal to the Dyaks the will of the great god
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>Singalang Burong. These birds are beautiful in
plumage, but, like most tropical birds, they have little
song, and their calls are shrill and piercing. They are
supposed to be the seven sons-in-law of Singalang
Burong, and the legend which tells of how the Dyaks
came to know them and to listen to their cries is given
in <a href="#Chap_XIV">Chap. XIV</a>. ("The Story of Siu").</p>

<p>The system of bird omens as carried out by the
Dyaks, is most complicated, and the younger men have
constantly to ask the older ones how to act when contradictory
omens are heard. The law and observance
of omens occupy a great share of the thoughts of the
Dyak.</p>

<p>Some idea of the method in which the Dyaks carry
out their system of omens may be learned from what
is done at the beginning of the yearly rice farming.
Some man who has the reputation of being fortunate,
and has had large paddy crops, will be the augur,
and undertake to obtain omens for a large area of land,
on which he and others intend to plant. This man
begins his work some time before the Dyaks begin
clearing the ground of jungle and high grass. He will
have to hear the cry of the <i>Nendak</i>, the <i>Katupong</i> and
the <i>Beragai</i>, all on his left. If these cries come from
birds on his right, they are not propitious. He
goes forth in the early morning, and wanders about
the jungle till the cry of the <i>Nendak</i> is heard on his left.
He will then break off a twig of anything growing
near, and take it home, and put it in a safe place.
But it may happen that some other omen bird or
animal is first to be seen or heard. In that case he
must give the matter up, return, and try his chance
another day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Thus, sometimes several days pass before he has
obtained his first omen. When he has heard the
<i>Nendak</i>, he will then listen for the <i>Katupong</i> and the
other birds in the necessary order. There are always
delays caused by the wrong birds being heard, and it
may be a month or more before he hears all the necessary
cries. When the augur has collected a twig for
each necessary omen bird, he takes these to the land
selected for farming, buries them in the ground, and
with a short form of address to the omen birds and
to Pulang Gana&mdash;the god of the earth&mdash;clears a small
portion of the ground of grass or jungle, and then
returns home. The magic virtues of the birds have
been conveyed to the land, and the work of
clearing it for planting may be begun at any
time.</p>

<p>The sacred birds can be bad omens as well as good.
If heard on the wrong side, or in the wrong order,
the planting on a particular piece of land must be
postponed, or altogether abandoned.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the omens necessary before
planting the seed. In a similar manner, before
beginning to build a house, or starting on a war
expedition, or undertaking any new line of action,
certain omens are required, if good fortune is to attend
them and the Fates be propitious.</p>

<p>The worst of all omens is to find anywhere on the
farm the dead body of any animal included in the
omen list. It infuses a deadly poison into the whole
crop. When such a terrible thing happens, the omen
is tested by killing a pig, and divining from the appearance
of its liver directly after death. If the liver be
pronounced to be of good omen, then all is well, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>if not, then all the paddy grown on that ground
must be sold or given away. Other people may
eat it, for the omen only affects those who own the
crop.</p>

<p>It is not only to the cry of birds that the Dyaks pay
heed. There are certain animals&mdash;the deer, the
armadillo, the lizard, the bat, the python, even the
rat, as well as certain insects&mdash;which all may give
omens under special circumstances. But these other
creatures are subordinate to the birds, from which
alone augury is sought at the beginning of any
important undertaking.</p>

<p>The Dyak pays heed to these omen creatures, not
only in his farming, but in all his journeyings, and in
any kind of work he may be engaged in. If he be
going to visit a friend, the cry of a bird of ill omen will
send him back. If he be engaged in carrying beams
from the jungle to his house, and hear a <i>Kutok</i>, or a
<i>Bejampong</i> or an <i>Embuas</i>, he will at once throw down
the piece of timber. So great is the Dyak belief in
omens, that a man will sometimes abandon a nearly-finished
boat simply because a bird of ill omen flies
across its bows. The labour of weeks will thus be
wasted. I have myself seen wooden beams and
posts left half finished in the jungle, and have
been told that some omen bird was heard while the
man was at work on them, and so they had to be
abandoned.</p>

<p>There are many omens which make a house unfit
for habitation. If a <i>Katupong</i> fly into it, or a <i>Beragai</i>
over the house, or an armadillo crawls up into it, the
Dyaks leave the house and build another for them to
live in. Sometimes, however, they sacrifice a pig,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>and examine the liver, and only abandon the house
if the liver is considered by experts to be of bad
omen.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dreams</span></h3>

<p>The Dyaks place implicit confidence in dreams.
Their theory is that during sleep the soul can hear,
see and understand, and so what is dreamt is what
really takes place. When anyone dreams of a distant
land, they believe that his soul has paid a flying visit
to that land.</p>

<p>In dreams, also, the gods and spirits are supposed
to bring charms to human beings. The story is often
told of how a man falls asleep and dreams that a spirit
came to him and gave certain charms, and lo! when
he awakes, he finds them in his hands. Or else he is
told in a dream to go to a certain spot at a special time
and pick up some stone there, which will have some
mysterious influence for good over his fortunes.</p>

<p>Dreams are looked upon by the Dyaks as the means
the gods and spirits use to convey their commands
to men, or to warn them of coming danger. Houses
are often deserted, and farming land, on which much
labour has been spent, abandoned on account of
dreams. Newly married couples often separate from
the same cause. It is no unusual thing for a man
or a woman to dream that the spirits are hungry and
need food. In that case the inmates of the Dyak
house organize a feast, and offerings are made to the
hungry spirits.</p>

<h2><a name="Chap_XIII" id="Chap_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<br />
<small>MARRIAGES AND BURIALS</small></h2>


<p>Marriages in all countries are occasions of rejoicing,
and it is the same among the Dyaks. The principal
part of the ceremony is the fetching of the bride from
her father's to the bridegroom's house. The women-folk
of the village, who are friends of the bridegroom's
family, set out in a boat, gaily decorated with an
awning of parti-coloured sheets, and with streamers
and flags flying, to an accompaniment of gongs and
drums and musical instruments, to fetch the bride
to her future home.</p>

<p>When the boat arrives at the landing-stage of the
bride's house, they all walk up&mdash;a gaily dressed crowd&mdash;and
are welcomed into the house. Here they sit
down and talk over the future prospects of the
young couple, chewing betel-nut and <i>sireh</i> (a kind
of pepper leaf) all the time. A portion of these
chewing ingredients are carefully set aside to be
used later on. The Dyak with his great love for
divination, cannot allow such an occasion to pass
without some attempt to find out the secrets of the
future.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="wedding" id="wedding"></a>
<img  src="images/wedding.jpg" width="371" height="600" alt="Girl in wedding dress" />
<div class="cap-vert">
<p class="caption">IN WEDDING FINERY</p>
</div></div>

<p>The company all sit down in the long common hall
of the Dyak house, and the betel-nut, <i>sireh</i>, etc.,
specially set aside for the ceremony, are brought
forward. A betel-nut is split into seven pieces by one
supposed to be lucky in matrimonial matters, and
these, together with the other ingredients of the betel-nut
mixture, are all put in a little basket, which is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>bound together with red cloth, and laid for a short
time upon the open platform adjoining the house.</p>

<p>The Master of the Ceremonies, who splits the betel-nut,
then makes a little speech, telling the assembled
guests that if either party should desert the other
without sufficient reason, the offending party shall be
fined such an amount as has been agreed upon.</p>

<p>The basket containing the split pieces of betel-nut
is then brought in and uncovered, and the contents
examined to ascertain the will of the gods. Should
the pieces of betel-nut, by some mystic power, increase
in number, the marriage will be an unusually happy
one; but should they decrease, it is a bad omen, and
the marriage must be postponed or relinquished
altogether. But, as a matter of fact, they neither
increase nor decrease, and this is taken to mean that
the wedding is one upon which the spirits have pronounced
neither a good nor a bad verdict.</p>

<p>This action gives the name to the marriage ceremony.
The Dyaks call marriage <i>Mlah Pinang</i>&mdash;"spitting
the betel-nut."</p>

<p>The contents of the little basket, used to discover
the will of the higher powers, is chewed by those
present just as other <i>pinang</i> and <i>sireh</i>, and the
marriage ceremony is over; the young couple are
lawfully man and wife.</p>

<p>For the wedding, the bride decks herself out in all
the finery she possesses, or can borrow from her
friends. Her wedding-dress consists of a short petticoat
of Dyak-woven cloth, which reaches to her knees.
Along the bottom edge of this there are sewed several
rows of tinsel, and of silver coins, below which probably
hang some rows of hawk-bells, which make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
tinkling sound as she walks. Round her waist are
several coils of brass or silver chain, and two or three
belts made of dollars or other silver coins linked
together. From her hips upwards, as far as her armpits,
she wears a corset formed by threading split
cane through a great number of small brass rings,
arranged so closely together as to completely hide
the cane. To this corset may be fixed two or three
bands of silver coins. Her armlets of brass or silver
extend as far up as her elbow. As many rings as she
possesses are on her fingers, and she wears necklaces of
small beads, worked in very beautiful patterns, and
finished off with a tassel of beads, or else a large number
of big silver or brass buttons strung together round
her neck. Her ears are decorated with filigreed studs
of silver gilt, with a setting of scarlet cloth behind the
filigree work to show them off.</p>

<p>In her hair is a towering comb of silver filigree work,
to which are attached a number of silver spangles,
which glitter with every movement of her head. She
wears her hair in a knot into which are stuck a number
of large brass hair-pins, decorated with beads and
little tags of red and yellow and white cloth. She
possesses a bright coloured jacket of Dyak-woven
cloth; but she does not wear it, it is slung over her
right shoulder.</p>

<p>After this detailed description of the bride's dress,
it is disappointing to learn that the bridegroom takes
no special pains to ornament his person. The men
wear a great deal of finery when they attend a feast,
or when they go on the war-path, but on the occasion
of his wedding, the bridegroom takes no extra trouble
over his apparel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Burials</span></h3>

<p>As soon as a man dies, the professional mourner sits
on a swing near the head of the corpse and sings a
long dirge, blaming the different parts of the house,
beginning with the roof-ridge and proceeding downwards,
for not keeping back the soul of the dead
man.</p>

<p>Then the corpse is carried out into the public part
of the house, and is covered with a Dyak sheet. By
his side are put his belongings&mdash;his clothes, his implements
of work, his shield, his sword, his spear&mdash;which
are to be buried with him, or placed on his
grave.</p>

<p>Early the following morning the body, wrapped in
mats, and secured with a light framework of wood,
is carried on the shoulders of four men, and, accompanied
by their friends, they go to the jungle. When
they come to the spot where a tree is to be cut down
for the coffin, a halt is made. A fowl is killed, and the
blood collected in a cup, and mixed with a little water.
Each person present is touched with the blood, to
propitiate the gods, and to secure safety from any evil
consequences to the persons engaged in the funeral
rites. They now set to work to make the coffin.
A tree is felled and the required length cut off. This
is split in two, and each half is hollowed out. The
corpse is then placed inside this rude coffin, the two
parts of which are now firmly lashed together with
cane.</p>

<p>They then proceed either on foot or by boat to the
place of burial. The trees in a Dyak burial-ground are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>not cut down, so there is nothing to distinguish it
from any ordinary jungle. The Dyaks regard a
cemetery with superstitious terror as the abode of
spirits, and never go to it except to bury their dead,
and when they do this, they do not stay longer than
they can help, but hurry away lest they should meet
some spirit from the other world.</p>

<p>The graves are rarely more than three feet deep.
The Dyaks dare not step into the grave to deepen it,
because, according to their superstitious ideas, any one
who does such a thing will die a violent death. They
use no spade or hoe to turn up the earth, but cut the
soil with their choppers, and throw up the mould
with their hands. They dig the grave as far as their
arms will reach, and no farther.</p>

<p>When the corpse is buried, there are placed either
in the grave or on it, for use in the next world, various
articles of clothing, personal ornaments, weapons of
warfare, implements of farm work, and even instruments
of music, according to the sex and natural
proclivities of the dead. Some of these belong to the
departed; others are given by friends as tokens of
affection.</p>

<p>When the grave has been filled with earth, it is
fenced round, and food and drink are placed in the
enclosure, and at either end something is put to
indicate the sex and favourite occupation of the
deceased. If the grave be that of a warrior, it is roofed
and decorated with streamers, and such of his weapons
as are not buried with him are hung about, and the
ground around is palisaded and spiked. The grave
of the hunter is distinguished by his spear, his blow-pipe
and quiver, together with the trophies of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>chase&mdash;stags' antlers, and boars' tusks. Some articles
of feminine attire or work&mdash;spindles, petticoats,
waist-rings, or water-gourds&mdash;indicate the graves of
women.</p>

<br />
<small>A DYAK LEGEND</small></h2>


<p>There are many fairy-tales and legends known to
the Dyaks of the present day. As they have no
written language, these have been handed down by
word of mouth, from generation to generation, from
ancient times. These tales and legends may be
divided into two classes: 1. Those which are mythical
and related as such, which are simply meant to interest
and amuse, and in these respects resemble the fairy-tales
familiar to us all. 2. And those believed by them
to be perfectly true, and to record events which have
actually taken place. These form in fact the mythology
of the Dyaks. The following legend is related
by them as explaining how they came to plant rice,
and to observe the omens of birds:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of Siu</span></h3>

<p>Many thousands of years ago, before the paddy
plant was known, the Dyaks lived on tapioca, yams,
potatoes and such fruit as they could find in the jungle.
It was not till Siu taught them to plant paddy<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that
such a thing as rice was known. The story of how he
came to know this article of food, and how he and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>son, Seragunting, introduced it among the Dyaks is
here set forth.</p>

<p>Siu was the son of a great Dyak chief. His father
died when he was quite a child, and at the time this
story begins, he had grown to manhood, and lived
with his mother, and was the head of a long Dyak
house in which lived some three hundred families. He
was strong and active, and handsome in appearance,
and there was no one in the country round equal to
him either in strength or comeliness.</p>

<p>He proposed to the young men of his house that they
should take their blow-pipes and darts and go into the
jungle to shoot birds. So one morning they all
started early. Each man had with him his bundle of
food for the day, and each went a different way, as
they wished to see, on returning in the evening, who
would be the most successful of them all.</p>

<p>Siu wandered about the whole morning in the jungle,
but, strange to say, he did not see any bird, nor did
he meet with any animal. Worn out with fatigue, he
sat down to rest under a large tree, and, feeling hungry,
he ate some of the food he had brought with him. It
was now long past midday, and he had not succeeded
in killing a single bird! Suddenly he heard, not far
off, the sound of birds, and hurrying in that direction,
he came to a wild fig-tree covered with ripe fruit,
which a very large number of birds were busy eating.
Never before had he seen such a sight! On this one
tree the whole feathered population of the forest
seemed to have assembled together!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="blowpipe" id="blowpipe"></a>
<img  src="images/blowpipe.jpg" width="371" height="600" alt="hunter with a blow-pipe" />
<div class="cap-vert">
<p class="caption">KILLING BIRDS WITH A BLOW-PIPE</p>
</div></div>

<p>Siu hid himself under the thick leaves of a shrub
growing near, and taking a poisoned dart, he placed it
in his blow-pipe and shot it out. He had aimed at one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>bird and hit it. But that bird was not the only one
that fell dead at his feet. To his astonishment, he saw
that many of the other birds near it were killed also.
Again he shot out a dart, and again the same thing
happened. In a very short time, Siu had killed as
many birds as he could carry.</p>

<p>He tried to return the same way he came, but soon
found himself in difficulties. He wandered about, and
walked several miles, but could not find the jungle
path which he had followed early in the day. It was
beginning to grow dusk, and Siu was afraid he would
have to spend the night in the jungle.</p>

<p>Great was his joy, just as he was giving up all hope,
to come to a garden and a path leading from it. Siu
followed this path, knowing it would lead him to some
house not far off. He soon came to a well, and near
at hand he saw the lights of a long Dyak house. He
stopped to have a bath, and hid the birds he was
carrying, and his blow-pipe and quiver in the brushwood
near the well, hoping to take them with him when
he started to return the next morning.</p>

<p>He walked up to the house, and when he came to the
bottom of the ladder leading up to it he shouted:
"Oh, you people in the house, will you allow a stranger
to walk up?" A voice answered, "Yes; come
up!"</p>

<p>He walked up into the house. To his surprise he
saw no one in the long public hall in front of the
different rooms. That part of a Dyak house, usually
so crowded, was quite empty. All was silent. Even
the person who answered him was not there to receive
him.</p>

<p>He saw a dim light further on, and walked towards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>it, wondering what had happened to all the people
of the house. Presently he heard a woman's voice in
the room say: "Sit down, Siu; I will bring out the
<i>pinang</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and <i>sireh</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to you." Soon a young and
remarkably pretty girl came out of the room with the
chewing ingredients, which she placed before him.</p>

<p>"Here you are at last, Siu," she said; "I expected
you would come earlier. How is it you are so late?"</p>

<p>Siu explained that he had stopped at the well to have
a bath, as he was hot and tired.</p>

<p>"You must be very hungry," said the girl; "wait
a moment while I prepare some food. After you have
eaten, we can have our talk together."</p>

<p>When Siu was left to himself, he wondered what
it all meant. Here was a long Dyak house built for
more than a hundred families to live in, and yet it
seemed quite deserted. The only person in it appeared
to be the beautiful girl who was cooking his
food for him. He was also surprised that she knew
his name, and expected him that day.</p>

<p>"Come in, Siu," said the voice from the room;
"your food is ready."</p>

<p>Siu was hungry, and went in at once. When they
had done eating, she cleared away the plates and tidied
the room. Then she spread out a new mat for him,
and brought out the <i>pinang</i> and <i>sireh</i>, and bade him
be seated as she wished to have a chat with him.</p>

<p>Siu had many questions to ask, but before he could
do so, she said to him, "Tell me of your own people,
and what news you bring from your country."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>"There is no news to give you," Siu replied. "We
have been rather badly off for food, as our potatoes
and yams did not turn out so well this year as we
hoped."</p>

<p>"Tell me what made you come in this direction, and
how it was you found out this house."</p>

<p>"While I was hunting in the jungle to-day, I lost
my way. After wandering about a long time, I found
a path which I followed and came to this house. It
was kind of you to take me in and give me food. If
I had not found this house, I should have had to spend
the night in the jungle. To-morrow morning you must
show me the way back to my village. My mother
is sure to be anxious about me. She is left all alone
now that I am away. My father died a long time ago,
and I am her only son."</p>

<p>"Do not go away as soon as to-morrow morning.
Stay here a few days at any rate."</p>

<p>At first Siu would not consent, but she spoke so
nicely to him, that she persuaded him to stay there at
least a week. Then he went out to the verandah, and
she brought out a mat for him to sleep on, and a sheet
to cover himself with. As Siu was very tired, he soon
fell sound asleep, and did not wake up till late the
following morning.</p>

<p>Now, though Siu knew it not, this was the house of the
great Singalang Burong, the ruler of the spirit-world.
He was able to change himself and his followers into
any form. When going forth on an expedition against
the enemy, he would transform himself and his
followers into birds, so that they might travel more
quickly. Over the high trees of the jungle, over the
broad rivers, sometimes even across the sea, Singalang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Burong and his flock would fly. There was no
trouble about food, for in the forests there were always
some wild trees in fruit, and while assuming the form
of birds, they lived on the food of birds. In his own
house and among his own people, Singalang Burong
appeared as a man. He had eight daughters, and the
girl who had cooked food for Siu was the youngest of
them.</p>

<p>After Siu had been in the house seven days, he
thought he ought to be returning to his own people.
By this time he was very much in love with the girl
who had been so kind to him, and he wished above all
things to marry her, and take her back with him to his
own country.</p>

<p>"I have been here a whole week," he said to her,
"I want to say something, and I hope you will not be
vexed with me."</p>

<p>"Speak on; I promise not to be angry at anything
you say."</p>

<p>"I have learnt to love you very much," said Siu,
"and I would like to marry you, if you will consent,
and take you with me to my own land. Also, I wish
you to tell me your name, and why this house is so
silent, and where all the people belonging to it are."</p>

<p>"I will consent to marry you, for I also love you.
But you must first promise me certain things. In the
first place, you must not tell your people of this house,
and what you have seen here. Then you must promise
faithfully not to hurt a bird or even to hold one in
your hands. If ever you break these promises, then
we cease to be man and wife."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Siu, "I promise not to speak of what
I have seen here until you give me leave to do so.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>And as you do not wish it, I will never hurt or handle
a bird."</p>

<p>"Now that you have promised what I wish, I will
tell you of myself and the people of this house," said
the maiden. "I am known to my friends as <i>Bunsu
Burong</i> (the youngest of the bird family), or <i>Bunsu
Katupong</i> (the youngest of the <i>Katupong</i> family).
This house as you noticed seems very empty. The
reason is that a month ago many of our people were
killed by some of the people in your house, and we are
still in mourning for them. As you know when our
relatives have lately died, we stay silent in our rooms,
and do not come out to receive visitors or entertain
them. On the morning of the day on which you
arrived, all the men of this house went on the war-path,
so as to obtain some human heads, to enable
us to put away our mourning. With us as with you,
it is necessary that one or more human heads be
brought into the house before the inmates can give up
sorrowing for their dead relatives and friends. All
the people in this house, when at home, are in the form
of human beings, but they are able to transform themselves
into birds. My father, Singalang Burong, is
the head of this house. I am the youngest of eight
sisters. We have no brothers alive; our only brother
died not long ago, and we are still in mourning for him,
and that is the reason why my sisters did not come out
to greet you."</p>

<p>Siu heard with surprise all she had to say. He
thought to himself that it was lucky he did not bring
up to the house the birds which he had killed in the
jungle, and that he had hidden them with his blow-pipe
and quiver containing poisoned darts in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>brushwood near the well. He determined to say
nothing about the matter, as probably some of her
friends and relations were among the birds that were
killed by him.</p>

<p>So Siu married Bunsu Burong, and continued to live
in the house for several weeks.</p>

<p>One day he said to his wife, "I have been here a
long time. My people must surely be wondering
where I am, and whether I am still alive. My mother
too must be very anxious about me. I should like
to return to my people, and I want you to accompany
me. My mother and my friends are sure to welcome
you as my wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I will gladly accompany you back to your
home. But you must remember and say nothing of
the things you have seen or heard in this house."</p>

<p>They started early the next day, taking with them
enough food for four days, as they expected the
journey would last as long as that. Siu's wife seemed
to know the way, and after journeying three days,
they came to the stream near the house, and they
stopped to have a bath. Some of the children of the
house saw them there, and ran up to the house and
said: "Siu has come back, and with him is a beautiful
woman, who seems to be his wife."</p>

<p>Some of the older people checked the children,
saying: "It cannot be Siu; he has been dead for a
long time. Don't mention his name, for if his mother
hears you talk of him, it will make her very unhappy."</p>

<p>But the children persisted in saying that it was
indeed Siu that they had seen. Just then Siu and his
wife appeared and walked up into the house.</p>

<p>Siu said to his wife: "The door before which I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>hang up my sword is the door of my room. Walk
straight in. You will find my mother there, and she
will gladly welcome you as her daughter-in-law."</p>

<p>When they came into the house, all the inmates
rushed out to meet them, and to congratulate Siu on
his safe return. They asked him many questions:
Where had he been living all this time? How he
came to be married? And what was the name of his
wife's country? But Siu answered little, as he
remembered the promise he had made to his wife,
that he would not speak of what he had seen in her
house.</p>

<p>When Siu hung up his sword, his wife pushed open
the door and walked in. Siu's mother was very
pleased to see her son, whom she had mourned as dead,
alive and well, and when told of his marriage, she
welcomed his wife with joy.</p>

<p>In process of time Siu's wife bore him a son, whom
they named Seragunting. He was a fine child, and
as befitted the grandson of Singalang Burong, he grew
big and strong in a miraculously short time, and when
he was three years old, he was taller and stronger than
others four times his age.</p>

<p>One day as Seragunting was playing with the other
boys, a man brought some birds which he had caught
in a trap. As he walked through the house, he passed
Siu who was sitting in the open verandah. Siu,
forgetting the promise he had made to his wife, asked
to see the birds, and he took one in his hands and
stroked it. His wife was sitting near, and she saw him
hold the bird, and was very vexed that he had broken
his promise to her.</p>

<p>She said to herself: "My husband has broken his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>word to me. He has done the thing he promised me
he would never do. I cannot stay in this house any
longer. I must return to the house of my father,
Singalang Burong."</p>

<p>She took the water-vessels in her hands, and went
out as if to fetch water. But when she came to the
well, she placed the water-gourds on the ground, and
disappeared into the jungle.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Seragunting, tired with his play,
came back in search of his mother. She was very
fond indeed of him, and he expected her to come to him
as soon as he called out to her. But he was disappointed.
No one answered his call, and when he
looked into the room, she was not there. He asked
his father where his mother was, and he told him she
had gone to the well to fetch water and would soon
be back.</p>

<p>But hour after hour passed and she did not return.
So Seragunting asked his father to accompany him to
the well to look for her. They found the water-vessels
there, but saw no signs of her. So they both
returned sadly to the house, taking back with them
the water-gourds which Siu's wife had left at the well.</p>

<p>Early the next day Seragunting and his father went
in search of her. They took with them only a little
food, as they expected to find her not far off. But
they wandered the whole day, and saw no signs of her.</p>

<p>They spent the night under a large tree in the jungle.
Early the next morning they were surprised to find a
small bundle of food, wrapped up in leaves, near
Seragunting. The food was evidently meant for him
alone, as it was not enough for two, but he gave some
of it to his father, who ate sparingly of it, so that his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>son might not be hungry. They wandered on for
several days, and every night the same thing occurred&mdash;a
bundle of food was placed near Seragunting.</p>

<p>After journeying many days, they came to the sea-shore.
Siu suggested to his son that they should
return, but Seragunting, who during the journey
had grown up into a strong lad with a will of his own,
would not consent to do so, as he was determined to
find his mother.</p>

<p>After waiting by the shore a few days, they saw a
dark cloud come to them over the sea. As it came
nearer, it took the form of a gigantic Spider, carrying
some food and clothes.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," said the Spider, "I have come
to help you and your father. I have brought you food
and clothing. When you have eaten, and changed
your clothes, I will take you to the land on the other
side."</p>

<p>They were told to follow the Spider. They did so.
Strange to say, the water became as hard as a sand-bank
under their feet. For a long time they were out
of sight of land, but towards evening they approached
the opposite shore. They saw several houses and one
larger and more imposing than the others. To this
house the Spider directed Seragunting telling him he
would find his mother there.</p>

<p>Seragunting's mother was very glad to see her son
and embraced him.</p>

<p>"How was it you went away and left us?" he
said. "We missed you so much, and have travelled
many days and nights in search of you. Now our
troubles are over, for I have found you."</p>

<p>"My dear son," she said as she caressed him,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>"though I left you, I did not forget you. It was I
who placed the food by you every night. I left your
father because he broke his promise to me. But you
are my own son, and I have been wishing to see you
ever since I left your house. It was I who sent the
Spider to help you and show you your way here."</p>

<p>Then she spoke to her husband Siu, whom she was
glad to meet again. All three then went out into the
verandah, which was now full of people.</p>

<p>Seragunting was told by his mother to call the
sons-in-law of Singalang Burong his uncles, but they
refused to acknowledge him as their nephew. They
proposed several ordeals to prove the truth of his words
that he was indeed the grandson of Singalang Burong.
In all these Seragunting came off victorious, and they
were compelled to admit that he was a true grandson
of the great Singalang Burong.</p>

<p>But Siu was unhappy in his new home. He could
not help thinking of his mother, whom he had left
alone, and he was anxious to return to his own people.
He begged his wife to accompany him back to his old
home, but she refused to do so. It was decided that
Siu and his son should stay with Singalang Burong till
they had obtained such knowledge as would be useful
to them in the future, and that then they were to
return to the other world, taking with them the secrets
they had learnt.</p>

<p>All the people of the house were now most kind to
Siu and his son, and were most anxious to teach them
all they could. They were taken on a war expedition
against the enemy, so that they might learn the
science and art of Dyak warfare. They were taught
how to set traps to catch deer and wild pig. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>were shown the different methods of catching fish,
and learnt to make the different kinds of fish-trap
used by Dyaks of the present day, and they remained
in Singalang Burong's house that whole year for the
purpose of acquiring a complete and practical knowledge
of the different stages of paddy growing.</p>

<p>When the year was ended, Seragunting's mother
took him and Siu to see her father. Singalang Burong
was seated in his chair of state, and received them
most kindly. He explained to Siu who he was, and
the worship due to him, and they learnt also about
the observance of omens, both good and bad.</p>

<p>"I am the ruler of the spirit-world," said Singalang
Burong, "and have power to make men successful
in all they undertake. At all times if you wish for
my help, you must call upon me and make offerings
to me.</p>

<p>"You have learnt here how to plant paddy. I will
give you some paddy to take away with you, and when
you get back to your own country, you can teach men
how to cultivate it. You will find rice a much more
strengthening article of food than the yams and
potatoes you used to live upon, and you will become
a strong and hardy race.</p>

<p>"And to help you in your daily work, my sons-in-law
will always tell you whether what you do is right
or wrong. In every work that you undertake, you
must pay heed to the voices of the sacred birds&mdash;<i>Katupong</i>,
<i>Beragai</i>, <i>Bejampong</i>, <i>Papau</i>, <i>Nendak</i>, <i>Kutok</i>
and <i>Embuas</i>. These birds, named after my sons-in-law,
represent them, and are the means by which I
make known my wishes to mankind. When you hear
them, remember it is myself speaking to you, through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>my sons-in-law, for encouragement or for warning.
I am willing to help you, but I expect due respect to
be paid to me, and will not allow my commands to be
disobeyed."</p>

<p>Siu and Seragunting bade their friends farewell,
and started to return. As soon as they had descended
the ladder of the house of Singalang Burong, they were
swiftly transported through the air by some mysterious
power, and in a moment they found themselves at
their own house.</p>

<p>Their friends crowded round them, glad to see them
back safe and well. The neighbours were told of their
return, and a great meeting was held that evening. All
gathered round the two adventurers, who told them
of their strange experiences in the far country of the
spirit birds. The new seed, paddy, was produced,
and the good qualities of rice as an article of food
explained. The different names of the sacred birds
were told to the assembled people, and all were warned
to pay due respect to their cries.</p>

<p>And so, according to the ancient legend, ended the
old primitive life of the Dyak, when he lived upon such
poor food as the fruits of the jungle, and any yams or
potatoes he happened to plant near the house; the
old blind existence in which there was nothing to guide
him; and then began for him his new life, in which
he advanced forward a step, and learnt to have
regularly, year by year, his seed-time and harvest,
and to know there were unseen powers ruling the
universe, whose will might be learnt by man,
and obedience to whom would bring success and
happiness.</p>

<h2><a name="Chap_XV" id="Chap_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />
<br />
<small>DYAK BELIEFS AND SUPERSTITIONS</small></h2>


<p>The Dyaks do not worship idols, but they believe in
certain gods and spirits, who are supposed to rule over
different departments of life, and to these deities they
make offerings and sing incantations at certain times.</p>

<p>The following are the more important gods among
the Dyaks.</p>

<p>Singalang Burong takes the highest position in
honour and dignity, and is the ruler of the spirit-world.
It is doubtful what the word <i>Singalang</i> means, but
<i>Burong</i> means "bird," and probably <i>Singalang
Burong</i> means "Bird Chief." The Dyaks are great
observers of omens (see <a href="#Chap_XII">Chapter XII</a>.), and among
their omens the cries of certain birds are most
important.</p>

<p>Singalang Burong is also the god of war, and the
guardian spirit of brave men. He delights in fighting,
and head-taking is his glory. When Dyaks have
obtained a human head, they make a great feast to the
honour of this god and invoke his presence. He is
the only god ever represented by the Dyaks in a
material form&mdash;a carved, highly-coloured bird of
grotesque shape. This figure at the <i>Head Feast</i> is
erected on the top of a pole, thirty feet or more in
height, with its beak pointing in the direction of the
enemy's country, so that he may "peck at the eyes
of the enemy."</p>

<p>Next in importance to Singalang Burong is Pulang
Gana, who is the god of the earth. He is an <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>important
power according to Dyak ideas, and to him
offerings are made and incantations sung at all feasts
connected with <i>Farming</i>. They are entirely dependent
upon his goodwill for a good harvest.</p>

<p>Salampandai is the maker of men. He hammers
them into shape out of clay, and forms the bodies of
children to be born into the world. There is an insect
which makes at night the curious noise&mdash;<i>kink-a-clink</i>,
<i>kink-a-clink</i>. When the Dyaks hear this, they say it
is Salampandai at his work. When each child is
formed, it is brought to the gods who ask, "What
would you like to handle or use?" If it answer,
"A sword," the gods pronounce it a male; but if it
answer, "Cotton and the spinning-wheel," it is pronounced
a female. Thus they are born as boys or
girls according to their own wishes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="youth" id="youth"></a>
<img  src="images/youth.jpg" width="371" height="600" alt="Youth with a sword" />
<div class="cap-vert">
<p class="caption">A DYAK YOUTH</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Dyak believes in the existence of spirits, and he
thinks that innumerable spirits inhabit the forests,
the rivers, the earth, and the air. Any unusual noise
or motion in the jungle, anything which suggests to the
mind some invisible operation, is at once attributed
by the Dyak to the presence of some spirit, unseen by
human eyes, but full of mighty power. Though
generally invisible, these spirits sometimes show
themselves. The form they assume then is not anything
very supernatural, but either a commonplace
human form or else some animal&mdash;a bird, or a monkey&mdash;such
as is often seen in the forests. There is, however,
the chief of evil spirits, Girgasi by name, who,
when seen, takes the form of a giant about three times
the size of a man, is covered with rough, shaggy hair,
and has eyes as big as saucers, and huge glittering
teeth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>There are innumerable stories told by Dyaks of their
meeting with spirits in the jungle, and sometimes
speaking to them. Such stories generally relate how
the man who sees the spirit rushes to catch him by
the leg&mdash;he cannot reach higher&mdash;in order to get some
charm from him, but he is generally foiled in his
attempt, as the spirit suddenly vanishes. But some
men, it is believed, do obtain gifts from the spirits.
If a Dyak gets a good harvest, it is attributed to some
magic charm he has received from some kindly spirit.
Also, if he be successful on the war-path, he is credited
with the succour of some mysterious being from the
spirit-world.</p>

<p>The spirits, according to the Dyaks, rove about
the jungle and hunt for wild beasts, as the Dyaks do
themselves. Girgasi, already mentioned, is specially
addicted to the chase, and the Dyaks say he is often
to be met hunting in the forest. There are certain
animals who roam about in packs in the jungle. These
are supposed to be the dogs which accompany the
spirits when they are out hunting, and they attack
those whom the spirits wish to kill. I have never seen
one of these animals, but to judge from the description
of them, they seem to be a kind of small jackal. They
will follow and bark at men, and from their supposed
connection with the spirits, are greatly feared by the
Dyaks, who generally run away from them as fast as
they can.</p>

<p>The spirits are said to build their invisible habitations
in trees, and many trees are considered sacred, as
being the abode of one or more spirits, and to cut
one of these trees down would be to provoke the
spirits' anger. The tops of hills are supposed to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>the favourite haunts of spirits. When Dyaks fell the
jungle of the larger hills, they always leave a clump of
trees at the summit as a refuge for the spirits. To
leave them quite homeless would be to court certain
disaster from them.</p>

<p>From what has been said it will be seen that the
spirits are much the same as their gods, and have
power either to bestow favours, or cause sickness and
death. They rule the conduct of the Dyak, and
therefore receive the same religious homage as their
gods do.</p>

<p>The Dyak worships his gods. He has good spirits
to help him, and evil spirits to harm him. He makes
sacrifices to the gods and spirits, and invokes their
help in long incantations. He has omens and divination
and dreams to encourage or warn him. He
believes he has a soul which will live in another world,
a future life differing little from his existence in the
flesh.</p>

<br />
<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>I have tried to tell you in the preceding chapters
what the Dyaks of Borneo are like, how they live, and
what their religious ideas are. It is sad to think of
them living in constant fear of evil spirits, and believing
in such things as the omens of birds. All Christians
must wish these people to be taught about God.
Christ came to earth to teach us the Truths of the
Gospel, and before He returned to Heaven, He told
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>His disciples, and, through His disciples, all
Christians: "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe
all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and
lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
world." In obedience to this command, missionaries
have gone out to Borneo, and many people in England,
who are not able to go out to Borneo themselves,
help in the good work by subscribing money to the
"Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign
Parts," which sends missionaries to Borneo. Many
of these missionaries live up-country at some mission
station far from the town. Here there is a mission
house where the missionary lives, a church where
regular services are held, and a school house where
boys live and are taught.</p>

<p>As many of the long Dyak village houses are built
at great distances from each other, the missionary,
who wishes to do good work among the Dyaks, must
not always live at his mission house, but must travel
from house to house. Only by visiting distant villages,
and living with the Dyaks as their guest, can the
missionary learn to understand the people.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a missionary story. A missionary in
Borneo visited a Dyak village house to teach the people
there about God and our Lord Jesus Christ. A crowd
of men, women and children listened to him, and
many a long evening did the missionary spend, sitting
on a mat in the long public verandah of the Dyak
house, and teaching those poor ignorant people. A
Dyak boy present asked the missionary if he might
go back with him to his school. The parents gave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>their consent, and the little boy accompanied the
missionary on his return to his mission house, and
attended the mission school. There, with other
children, the boy was taught the Truths of the Christian
Religion. After being in school for a few years, this
boy returned to his Dyak home.</p>

<p>Years passed. The boy did not forget what he had
been taught at school. He saw the Dyaks among
whom he lived, ruled by a fear of evil spirits, and
carrying out many superstitious ceremonies, which he
knew must be displeasing to God. As he grew older,
he felt sad to think of the ignorance of his relatives and
friends, and of the Dyaks in other villages. So he
went back to the missionary and asked that he should
be taught more, so that, later on, he might teach his
own people, and bring some of them into God's
Kingdom.</p>

<p>This is a true story of what has happened more
than once in Borneo. A boy learns about God in some
up-country mission school, and on his return to his
Dyak home, is sorry to see the ignorance of his
people, and asks to be taught more, so that he
may become a Catechist and carry God's Truth to
them.</p>

<p>When the seed is sown, it lies in the ground, and
God sends the sunshine and the rain to make it grow.
So the Good Seed of the Word of God is sown in the
hearts of the Dyaks in Borneo, and we pray the Great
Giver of the Water of Life to refresh it with His Life-giving
Holy Spirit. Some seeds fall on the wayside,
and the birds of the air devour them; some fall on a
rock, and are scorched by the heat of the sun; some
fall among thorns, and are choked; but, thank
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>God, some fall on good ground and bring forth good
fruit.</p>

<p>The Good Seed of God's Word is being sown among
the old and young in Borneo. Will you not take a
share in that good work?</p>
